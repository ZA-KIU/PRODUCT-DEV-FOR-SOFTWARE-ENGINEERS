# Lab 5: Problem Synthesis Workshop
**Duration:** 120 minutes (in-lab)  
**Week:** 5  
**Focus:** Transform 10+ interviews into a validated, evidence-based problem statement

---

## üìã Pre-Lab Requirements

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Teams Must Bring
- [ ] **ALL completed interview logs** (minimum 8, target 10+)
  - Printed copies OR laptops with access to GitHub repo
  - Each log must have 3+ verbatim quotes
- [ ] **Laptops** (at least 2 per team)
- [ ] **Sticky notes OR digital board access** (Miro/FigJam/Jamboard)
- [ ] **Markers** (if using physical sticky notes)

### Pre-Lab Checklist
Before lab begins, each team must have:
- [ ] 8+ interview logs committed to `/01-discovery/interview-logs/`
- [ ] Each log has 3+ verbatim quotes
- [ ] Each log has specific story/example
- [ ] Each log has consequences/impact documented
- [ ] GitHub repo accessible to all team members

**‚ö†Ô∏è If your team has fewer than 8 completed logs, you will NOT be able to do quality synthesis. Plan accordingly.**

---

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:
- ‚úÖ Systematically extract insights from qualitative interview data
- ‚úÖ Use affinity mapping to identify patterns across multiple interviews
- ‚úÖ Distinguish between symptoms and root causes
- ‚úÖ Craft an evidence-based problem statement backed by data
- ‚úÖ Make strategic decisions about pivoting vs. refining your problem

---

## üîÑ The Synthesis Process

Today you'll execute a 4-step process to go from raw interview data to validated problem statement:

```
10+ Interview Logs ‚Üí Affinity Map ‚Üí Pattern Analysis ‚Üí Problem Statement
```

**Quality equation:** `Better interviews = Better synthesis = Better product`

## üìù Detailed Lab Activities

### Part 0: Setup & Homework Check (0:00 - 0:05)

**Instructor Actions:**
- Quick attendance
- Verify each team has required materials
- Identify teams with <8 interviews (flag for instructor intervention)

**Team Actions:**
- Sit together as full team
- Lay out all interview logs (printed or pull up on laptops)
- Open digital whiteboard OR prepare physical sticky notes
- Designate one person as "Scribe" to document on GitHub

---

### Part 1: Gather Evidence (0:05 - 0:30) ‚Äî 25 minutes

**Goal:** Get the entire team refreshed on ALL interview data before analysis begins.

**Why this matters:** You can't find patterns if you don't remember what people said. This step ensures everyone has a fresh, shared understanding of all 10 interviews.

#### Process:

**Round-Robin Reading (20 minutes):**
1. Each team member takes turns reading their interview logs aloud
2. For each log, share:
   - Who the interviewee was (ICP verification)
   - The specific story they told
   - 2-3 most powerful verbatim quotes
   - Key pain points mentioned
   - Current workarounds they use

**Quick Reactions (5 minutes):**
3. After all interviews are read, do a quick verbal round:
   - "What surprised you most?"
   - "What did you hear repeatedly?"
   - "What contradictions did you notice?"

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** Don't analyze yet. Just listen and absorb. Pattern identification comes next.

**Output:** Whole team has fresh memory of all interview data.

---

### Part 2: Affinity Mapping (0:30 - 1:15) ‚Äî 45 minutes

**Goal:** Group similar insights together to reveal hidden patterns.

**Why this matters:** Your brain naturally seeks patterns, but biases can blind you. This structured process forces you to see what the DATA says, not what you want it to say.

#### Tools Setup:
- **Physical:** Large wall space, 100+ sticky notes, markers
- **Digital:** Miro/FigJam board, one person screen-shares while all contribute

#### Process:

**Step 2A: Extract Insights (15 minutes)**

Go through EACH interview log systematically:

1. **Find key insights:** Look for:
   - Verbatim quotes (especially emotional ones)
   - Specific pain points mentioned
   - Workarounds they've built
   - Consequences/impacts they described
   - Frequency indicators ("every day," "constantly," "always")

2. **Write ONE insight per sticky note:**
   - Use interviewee's exact words when possible
   - Keep it atomic (one idea per note)
   - Include interviewee ID for traceability (e.g., "P03")
   
   **Example sticky notes:**
   ```
   "I have to check four different apps every morning 
   just to know what I need to do today" - P001
   ```
   
   ```
   "Every Sunday I spend two hours copying deadlines 
   from LMS to Google Calendar to Notion" - P001
   ```
   
   ```
   "I'm basically the human central database for 
   my team" - P003
   ```

3. **Target: 50-100 sticky notes total** (across all interviews)
   - 10 interviews √ó 5-10 insights each = 50-100 notes
   - If you have fewer than 40 notes, dig deeper into your logs

**Step 2B: Cluster Similar Insights (20 minutes)**

1. **Start randomly:** Put all sticky notes on the board/wall without organization

2. **Find natural groups:** 
   - Move notes with similar themes close together
   - Don't force categories‚Äîlet them emerge naturally
   - It's okay to move notes multiple times
   - Some notes might not fit anywhere (set them aside)

3. **Keep clustering until stable:**
   - You should see 5-8 clear clusters forming
   - Each cluster should have 5-15 notes
   - If a cluster has 20+ notes, it's probably two clusters combined

**Step 2C: Label Clusters (10 minutes)**

1. **Name each cluster** with a descriptive phrase:
   - ‚úÖ Good: "WhatsApp message overload"
   - ‚úÖ Good: "Last-minute consolidation panic"
   - ‚úÖ Good: "Unclear task ownership"
   - ‚ùå Bad: "Communication issues" (too vague)
   - ‚ùå Bad: "Problem 1" (not descriptive)

2. **Document your map:**
   - Take photos (if physical)
   - Export board (if digital)
   - Scribe begins drafting `/01-discovery/synthesis/affinity-map.md`

**Output:** Visual map of themes with supporting evidence.

---

### Part 3: Pattern Recognition (1:15 - 1:45) ‚Äî 30 minutes

**Goal:** Identify which patterns are STRONGEST and MOST IMPORTANT.

**Why this matters:** Not all pain points are created equal. You need to find the ones that are both FREQUENT (many people) and INTENSE (causes real harm).

#### Process:

**Step 3A: Count Frequency (10 minutes)**

For each cluster, create a frequency table:

| Theme/Cluster | # Interviews Mentioned | # Supporting Quotes |
|---------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| WhatsApp buried messages | 8/10 | 12 |
| Last-minute consolidation panic | 9/10 | 15 |
| Unclear task ownership | 7/10 | 10 |
| ... | ... | ... |

**Frequency Rules:**
- **High frequency:** 7+ interviews mentioned = Strong pattern
- **Medium frequency:** 4-6 interviews mentioned = Moderate pattern
- **Low frequency:** 1-3 interviews mentioned = Weak pattern (might be outlier)

**Step 3B: Assess Pain Intensity (10 minutes)**

For each cluster, rate emotional intensity:

Look for:
- Strong emotional words: "frustrating," "anxious," "overwhelming," "terrifying"
- Physical impacts: "migraines," "couldn't sleep," "exhaustion"
- Severe consequences: "failed the class," "almost deported," "damaged reputation"

Rate each cluster:
- **üî• High intensity:** Strong emotions + severe consequences
- **üòê Medium intensity:** Moderate annoyance + some impact
- **üò∂ Low intensity:** Mild inconvenience + minimal impact

**Step 3C: Find Root Causes (10 minutes)**

For your TOP 3 clusters (highest frequency √ó intensity), ask:

**"Why does this problem exist?"** (not "what is the problem?")

Use the 5 Whys technique:
1. Why do students use 4+ disconnected tools?
   - *Because there's no single system that does everything*
2. Why isn't there a single system?
   - *Because different stakeholders own different tools (LMS, WhatsApp, etc.)*
3. Why can't students consolidate themselves?
   - *Because automation is hard to trust and manual consolidation takes too much time*

**Root cause vs. symptom:**
- ‚ùå Symptom: "Students are stressed about deadlines"
- ‚úÖ Root cause: "No centralized system for deadline management"

**Output:** Ranked list of top 3-5 patterns with frequency, intensity, and root causes documented.

**Scribe action:** Draft `/01-discovery/synthesis/patterns-analysis.md`

---

### Part 4: Problem Statement Draft (1:45 - 1:55) ‚Äî 10 minutes

**Goal:** Start crafting your evidence-based problem statement.

**Why this matters:** This statement will guide EVERYTHING you build for the rest of the semester. Get it wrong here, and you'll build the wrong thing.

#### Decision Time: Keep, Refine, or Pivot?

Look at your pattern analysis and decide:

**‚òëÔ∏è KEEP original statement if:**
- Original problem validated by 8+ interviews
- Root cause matches your hypothesis
- Clear patterns emerged supporting your original thinking

**üîÑ REFINE statement if:**
- Core problem validated BUT deeper understanding emerged
- Need to add specificity (who, what, when, where, why)
- Original was too broad or too narrow

**üîÄ PIVOT to new problem if:**
- Original problem NOT validated by interviews
- Different problem emerged as more significant
- Can't find 10+ people with original problem

#### Drafting Your Statement

Use this template:

> **"[Specific user segment] [lose/waste/experience] [quantified impact] because [root cause] [in context], leading to [consequences]."**

**Requirements:**
- **WHO:** Specific user segment (not "students" but "KIU CS students working on group projects")
- **WHAT:** Specific failure or loss (not "have trouble" but "miss 30-40% of milestones")
- **IMPACT:** Quantified time/money/emotion (not "frustrating" but "2-3 hours per week wasted")
- **WHY:** Root cause, not symptom (not "are confused" but "lack shared visibility into task ownership")
- **WHEN/WHERE:** Context (not always but "during peak hours 10 AM - 2 PM")
- **CONSEQUENCES:** Real impact (not "annoyed" but "failed the class," "damaged reputation")

**Cite your evidence:**
- Reference specific interviews: "Validated by 8/10 interviews (P001, P002, P003, P004, P005, P007, P008, P010)"
- Include powerful quotes in your documentation

**Team activity:** Spend 10 minutes drafting your statement together. ONE person writes while everyone contributes.

**Output:** Draft problem statement (to be finalized as homework).

# Final Problem Statement

## Statement
"University students across diverse academic contexts lack intelligent 
systems that understand their specific workflows and provide reliable, 
context-aware deadline management, leading to unsustainable time 
investments (2-15 hours/week), chronic stress, and compromised 
performance across multiple domains."

## Evidence (8/10 interviews)
- P001: "I have to check four different apps every morning..."
- P002: "Critical deadline changes get lost in WhatsApp..."
- [etc.]

## Decision: REFINED
**Original:** "Students lack centralized system for deadline tracking"
**What changed:** Added "intelligent," "context-aware," "reliable" 
based on interview findings that centralization alone is insufficient.

## Confidence Level: High
**Why:** Consistent patterns across 5 diverse student types, emotional 
validation, real consequences documented, multiple custom solutions 
built by users (proving need).
```

## üö® Common Mistakes to Avoid

### During Affinity Mapping:
- ‚ùå Writing interpretations instead of quotes
  - Bad: "User is frustrated"
  - Good: "I wanted to throw my laptop across the room" - P003
- ‚ùå Making clusters too broad ("Problems," "Issues")
- ‚ùå Forcing data to fit your original hypothesis
- ‚ùå Ignoring contradictory evidence

### During Pattern Recognition:
- ‚ùå Confusing frequency with intensity
  - 10/10 people mentioned "mildly annoying" ‚â† important
  - 3/10 people had "catastrophic consequences" = might be important
- ‚ùå Focusing on symptoms instead of root causes
  - Symptom: "Students are stressed"
  - Root cause: "No centralized deadline management system"
- ‚ùå Cherry-picking quotes that support your bias

### In Problem Statement:
- ‚ùå Being too vague: "Students have trouble with organization"
- ‚ùå Not quantifying impact: "Students waste time" (how much?)
- ‚ùå Missing context: "Students can't find study spots" (when? where?)
- ‚ùå Ignoring evidence: Statement not supported by 8+ interviews

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Trust the process:** Affinity mapping feels chaotic at first. That's normal. Patterns will emerge.

2. **Look for surprising insights:** The best findings are things you DIDN'T expect going into interviews.

3. **Embrace pivots:** If your original problem isn't validated, that's a SUCCESS not a failure. You learned the truth before wasting weeks building the wrong thing.

4. **Quality over quantity:** 8 excellent interview logs > 15 mediocre ones. If your logs lack depth, schedule 2-3 more interviews this week.

5. **Cite obsessively:** Every claim in your problem statement should reference specific interviews and quotes.

6. **Be specific:** "KIU CS students in group projects" beats "students" every time.

## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: What if we only have 7 completed interviews?**  
A: You CAN proceed with synthesis, but your patterns will be weaker. Schedule 3 more interviews this week and update your analysis before Friday.

**Q: What if our interviews contradict each other?**  
A: GOOD! Contradictions reveal important nuances. Document them in your analysis. You might have multiple user segments with different needs.

**Q: Can we change our problem statement after Week 5?**  
A: Minor refinements = yes. Major pivots = only with instructor approval. After Week 5, you need stability to build.

**Q: What if we decide to pivot to a completely different problem?**  
A: Schedule office hours THIS WEEK. You'll need to do 5-10 new interviews quickly. This is high-risk but sometimes necessary.

**Q: Our affinity map has 15 clusters. Is that too many?**  
A: Yes. Look for ways to combine clusters. You should have 5-8 major themes. More than that indicates you're not grouping similar ideas.

**Q: What if our team disagrees on the problem statement?**  
A: Use evidence to decide. Which statement is supported by MORE interviews? If still tied, Program Lead makes final call (per your team contract). Document dissenting opinions.

## üéì Why This Matters

This is the MOST IMPORTANT lab of the entire semester.

Everything that follows‚Äîyour design, your prototype, your MVP, your go-to-market strategy‚Äîdepends on getting this problem statement right.

**Get this wrong** ‚Üí You build a beautiful solution to a problem nobody has  
**Get this right** ‚Üí You build something people actually need and will use

The next 10 weeks of work depend on the quality of the synthesis you do TODAY.

Take it seriously. Trust the process. Follow the evidence.
