## Decision Documentation

### Original Problem Statement (Week 2)

**Our original problem statement was:**  
> "[Your Week 2 problem statement here]"

### Decision: ‚òê KEEP  ‚òê REFINE  ‚òê PIVOT

**We decided to [KEEP / REFINE / PIVOT] because:**

[2-3 paragraphs explaining your decision with evidence]

- Explain how interviews validated your original hypothesis
- What additional insights you gained
- What you learned about the depth/severity of the problem

**IF REFINE:**
- What core elements stayed the same?
- What changed and why?
- How interviews deepened your understanding
- What specificity you added (WHO, WHAT, HOW MUCH, WHY, WHEN, CONSEQUENCES)

**IF PIVOT:**
- Why the original problem wasn't validated
- What problem emerged as more significant
- How you discovered this new problem
- Evidence for the new problem (must still have 8+ interviews)
- Plan for additional interviews if needed

## Confidence Assessment

### Overall Confidence Level

**‚òê LOW Confidence**  
(Weak patterns, inconsistent evidence, small sample, concerns about validation)

**‚òê MEDIUM Confidence**
