## Process Reflections

### What Surprised Us
[2-3 sentences about unexpected patterns or insights that emerged during affinity mapping]

### Challenges We Faced
[2-3 sentences about difficulties during the clustering process and how you resolved them]

### Key Learnings
[2-3 sentences about what you learned from this exercise about your problem space]

## Next Steps

Based on this affinity map, our top 3 clusters (by frequency and intensity) that we'll analyze further are:

1. [Cluster name]
2. [Cluster name]
3. [Cluster name]

These will form the basis of our pattern analysis and problem statement refinement.
