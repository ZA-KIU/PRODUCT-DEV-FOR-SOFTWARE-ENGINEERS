**Team:** [Your Team Name]  
**Date:** [Date]  
**Product:** [Your Product Name]  
**Timeline:** [e.g., Weeks 6-8]

---

## Executive Summary

**Purpose of this document:**  
This plan outlines HOW we'll implement analytics for our product, including technical architecture, tooling, timeline, and team responsibilities.

**Key Decisions:**
- **Analytics Platform:** [e.g., Segment, Mixpanel, Custom solution]
- **Implementation Approach:** [e.g., Frontend + Backend tracking]
- **Timeline:** [e.g., 3 weeks from Week 6 to Week 8]
- **Success Criteria:** [e.g., All core events firing by Week 8]

---

## Goals & Success Criteria

### What We're Trying to Achieve

**Primary Goals:**
1. **Track North Star Metric:** Ability to measure [your NSM] accurately
2. **Monitor AARRR Funnel:** Track all 5 stages (Acquisition → Revenue)
3. **Enable Data-Driven Decisions:** Dashboard for weekly team review
4. **Ensure Data Quality:** 95%+ event delivery success rate

**Success Criteria for Analytics Implementation:**

| Criterion | Target | How We'll Measure |
|-----------|--------|-------------------|
| Event Coverage | 6-10 core events instrumented | Count of implemented events |
| Data Accuracy | <5% event loss rate | Compare sent vs received events |
| Dashboard Availability | Real-time (< 1 min delay) | Test event → dashboard latency |
| Team Adoption | 100% team using dashboard weekly | Dashboard view tracking |
| Performance Impact | < 50ms added latency | Performance monitoring |

## Analytics Architecture

### High-Level Design

**Components:**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Action in App] --> B{Event Triggered}
    B --> C[Analytics Client SDK]
    C --> D[Event Validation]
    D --> E[Analytics Platform]
    E --> F[Data Warehouse]
    F --> G[Dashboard/BI Tool]
    
    C --> H[Local Storage Queue]
    H --> E
    
    E --> I[Alerts & Monitoring]
```

**Description:**  
[Briefly describe how data flows from user action to dashboard]

**Example:**
"When a user completes a study session, our frontend triggers `study_session_completed` event. The analytics SDK validates the event schema, queues it locally, and sends it asynchronously to Segment. Segment forwards to our data warehouse (BigQuery) where it's processed and displayed in our Grafana dashboard within 60 seconds."

### Technology Stack

| Component | Tool/Service | Version | Justification |
|-----------|-------------|---------|---------------|
| **Analytics Platform** | [e.g., Segment, Mixpanel, Amplitude] | [Version] | [Why this tool?] |
| **Data Warehouse** | [e.g., BigQuery, PostgreSQL, MongoDB] | [Version] | [Why this tool?] |
| **Visualization** | [e.g., Grafana, Metabase, Amplitude] | [Version] | [Why this tool?] |
| **Client SDK** | [e.g., analytics.js, Native SDKs] | [Version] | [Why this tool?] |
| **Backend Tracking** | [e.g., Node.js library, Python SDK] | [Version] | [Why this tool?] |

**Example:**
- **Analytics Platform:** Segment (Free tier) - Industry standard, easy integration, supports multiple destinations
- **Data Warehouse:** PostgreSQL 15.3 - We already use it, no additional cost
- **Visualization:** Grafana (Open source) - Free, flexible, team knows it from other projects
- **Client SDK:** Segment analytics.js 2.0 - Works with our React app
- **Backend Tracking:** Segment Node.js SDK 2.0 - Consistent with frontend

---

### Alternative Solutions Considered

| Solution | Pros | Cons | Why Not Chosen |
|----------|------|------|----------------|
| [Option 1] | [Pros] | [Cons] | [Reasoning] |
| [Option 2] | [Pros] | [Cons] | [Reasoning] |

**Example:**
- **Google Analytics:** Free, familiar → Too limited for custom events, doesn't support our event schema
- **Mixpanel:** Great UI, built for products → $25/mo after trial, over budget for MVP
- **Custom solution:** Full control, free → Too time-consuming to build, not core to MVP

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend (Web/Mobile)

**Framework:** [e.g., React, React Native, Flutter]

**Installation Steps:**
```bash
# Example for Segment
npm install @segment/analytics-next
```

**Configuration:**
```javascript
// Example analytics initialization
import { AnalyticsBrowser } from '@segment/analytics-next'

export const analytics = AnalyticsBrowser.load({
  writeKey: process.env.REACT_APP_SEGMENT_WRITE_KEY
})

// Wrapper function for consistent tracking
export function trackEvent(eventName, properties = {}) {
  const standardProps = {
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    platform: 'web',
    app_version: process.env.REACT_APP_VERSION,
    environment: process.env.NODE_ENV
  };
  
  analytics.track(eventName, {
    ...standardProps,
    ...properties
  });
}
```

**Usage Example:**
```javascript
// In your React component
import { trackEvent } from './analytics';

function SignupButton() {
  const handleClick = () => {
    trackEvent('user_signup_started', {
      signup_method: 'google',
      referral_source: 'instagram'
    });
    // ... rest of signup logic
  };
  
  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Sign Up</button>;
}
```

---

### Backend (API/Server)

**Framework:** [e.g., Node.js/Express, Python/Flask, Ruby/Rails]

**Installation Steps:**
```bash
# Example for Node.js + Segment
npm install @segment/analytics-node
```

**Configuration:**
```javascript
// Example backend analytics setup
const Analytics = require('@segment/analytics-node');

const analytics = new Analytics({
  writeKey: process.env.SEGMENT_WRITE_KEY,
  flushAt: 20,      // Flush every 20 events
  flushInterval: 10000  // Or every 10 seconds
});

function trackEvent(userId, eventName, properties = {}) {
  analytics.track({
    userId: userId,
    event: eventName,
    properties: {
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
      platform: 'api',
      app_version: process.env.APP_VERSION,
      environment: process.env.NODE_ENV,
      ...properties
    }
  });
}

module.exports = { trackEvent };
```

**Usage Example:**
```javascript
// In your API endpoint
app.post('/api/sessions', async (req, res) => {
  const session = await createSession(req.body);
  
  trackEvent(req.user.id, 'study_session_created', {
    session_id: session.id,
    session_type: session.type,
    subject: session.subject
  });
  
  res.json(session);
});
```

**Access:** All team members

**Example Mockup:**
```
╔════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  North Star Metric: Weekly Active Sessions    ║
║                                                ║
║  Current: 142                  ▲ +12% vs LW   ║

### AARRR Funnel Dashboard

**View:** Funnel visualization

**Stages:**
1. **Acquisition:** Signup started → Signup completed
2. **Activation:** Signup completed → First [core action] within 48h
3. **Retention:** Activated users → Still active on Day 7
4. **Referral:** Active users → Sent invite
5. **Revenue:** (If applicable) Active users → Paid

**Conversion Rates:**
- Acquisition: [Target %]
- Activation: [Target %]
- Retention: [Target %]
- Referral: [Target %]
- Revenue: [Target %]

**Alerts:**
- If any stage drops below [X%], send Slack alert to team

---

### Weekly Review Dashboard

**Purpose:** Team looks at this every Monday

**Sections:**
1. **North Star Metric:** Current value, trend, WoW change
2. **AARRR Funnel:** All stages with conversion rates
3. **Top Features:** Most used features this week
4. **Drop-off Points:** Where users are leaving
5. **Cohort Analysis:** How different user groups are performing

---

## Data Quality & Monitoring

### Validation Rules

**Pre-send validation (in code):**
- Required properties present
- Data types match schema
- Enum values are valid
- String lengths within limits
- No PII accidentally included

**Example validation function:**
```javascript
function validateEvent(eventName, properties) {
  const schema = EVENT_SCHEMAS[eventName];
  
  // Check required properties
  for (const prop of schema.required) {
    if (!(prop in properties)) {
      throw new Error(`Missing required property: ${prop}`);
    }
  }
  
  // Check data types
  for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(properties)) {
    const expectedType = schema.properties[key].type;
    if (typeof value !== expectedType) {
      throw new Error(`Invalid type for ${key}: expected ${expectedType}`);
    }
  }
  
  return true;
}
```

---

### Error Handling

**Client-side errors:**
- Log to console in development
- Send to error monitoring (Sentry) in production
- Queue failed events for retry
- Don't block user experience

**Server-side errors:**
- Log to application logs
- Alert on-call engineer if > 10% failure rate
- Retry with exponential backoff
- Store failed events for manual reprocessing

---

### Monitoring & Alerts

**Daily Checks:**
- [ ] Event volume within expected range (± 20%)
- [ ] No events with 100% failure rate
- [ ] Dashboard loading within 3 seconds
- [ ] Data freshness < 5 minutes

**Alerts to Set Up:**

| Condition | Alert Channel | Recipient |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| Event failure rate > 10% | Slack | Tech Lead |
| Zero events for 1 hour | Email + Slack | Entire team |
| NSM drops 20% WoW | Slack | Product Lead |
| Dashboard down > 5 min | SMS | Tech Lead |

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

**What to test:**
- Event tracking functions
- Property validation
- Error handling
- Retry logic

**Example test:**
```javascript
describe('trackEvent', () => {
  it('should include all required properties', () => {
    const event = trackEvent('user_signup_started', {
      signup_method: 'google'
    });
    
    expect(event).toHaveProperty('event_id');
    expect(event).toHaveProperty('user_id');
    expect(event).toHaveProperty('timestamp');
    expect(event.signup_method).toBe('google');
  });
  
  it('should throw error for missing required property', () => {
    expect(() => {
      trackEvent('user_signup_started', {});
    }).toThrow('Missing required property: signup_method');
  });
});
```

---

### Integration Tests

**What to test:**
- Events fire on user actions
- Events reach analytics platform
- Events appear in dashboard

**Testing approach:**
1. Automated tests in CI/CD for critical paths
2. Manual QA checklist for full user flows
3. Staging environment mirrors production setup

---

### End-to-End Testing

**User Flow Test Example:**

**Scenario:** New user signs up and completes first session

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to signup page
2. Click "Sign up with Google"
3. Complete signup form
4. Verify `user_signup_started` fired
5. Verify `user_signup_completed` fired
6. Create first study session
7. Complete session
8. Verify `study_session_completed` fired
9. Check dashboard for all events
10. Verify NSM updated correctly

**Expected Results:**
- All events present in analytics platform within 60 seconds
- Properties match expected schema
- NSM increments by 1
- No errors in browser console
