## üìã Part A: Synthesis (4-6 hours)

### What You Did in Lab (Friday)

You spent 2 hours in lab doing:
- Reviewing all 10 interview logs together
- Creating an affinity map (50-100 sticky notes clustered into themes)
- Identifying patterns (frequency + intensity)
- Starting your problem statement draft

### What You Do for Homework

Now you **document** and **finalize** that work.

---

### Deliverable 1: Affinity Map Documentation

**File:** `/01-discovery/synthesis/affinity-map.md`  
**Template:** [Download here](computer:///mnt/user-data/outputs/Lab-5-COMPLETE-WITH-ANALYTICS/templates/affinity-map-template.md)  
**Time:** 60-90 minutes  
**Worth:** 5 points

**What to include:**
- Photos or screenshots of your affinity map from lab
- List all your clusters (5-8 clusters)
- For each cluster, include 3-5 sample quotes from interviews
- Short reflection on your process

**Tips:**
- Take clear photos if you used physical sticky notes
- If digital (Miro/FigJam), export or screenshot the board
- Make sure interviewee IDs are visible (P001, P002, etc.)
- Write brief descriptions of what each cluster represents

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
‚ùå Forgetting to take photos of your physical board  
‚ùå Not documenting which interviews mentioned each theme  
‚ùå Vague cluster names like "Problem 1" instead of "WhatsApp message overload"

---

### Deliverable 2: Patterns Analysis

**File:** `/01-discovery/synthesis/patterns-analysis.md`  
**Template:** [Download here](computer:///mnt/user-data/outputs/Lab-5-COMPLETE-WITH-ANALYTICS/templates/patterns-analysis-template.md)  
**Time:** 90-120 minutes  
**Worth:** 7 points

**What to include:**
- **Frequency table:** Count how many interviews mentioned each cluster
- **Intensity ratings:** Rate emotional impact (High üî• / Medium üòê / Low üò∂)
- **Root cause analysis:** Use "5 Whys" for your top 3-5 patterns
- **Current workarounds:** What do people do today?

**Example frequency table:**
| Cluster | # Interviews | # Quotes | Intensity |
|---------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| WhatsApp overload | 8/10 | 12 | üî• High |
| Last-minute panic | 9/10 | 15 | üî• High |
| Unclear ownership | 7/10 | 10 | üòê Medium |

**Tips:**
- Be honest about the data - if a pattern only appeared in 2/10 interviews, that's a weak pattern
- Focus your root cause analysis on HIGH frequency AND HIGH intensity patterns
- The 5 Whys technique: Keep asking "why?" until you get to the real underlying cause

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
‚ùå Confusing symptoms with root causes ("students are stressed" is a symptom, not a root cause)  
‚ùå Guessing numbers instead of actually counting interviews  
‚ùå Picking patterns YOU like instead of what the DATA shows

---

### Deliverable 3: Final Problem Statement

**File:** `/01-discovery/synthesis/final-problem-statement.md`  
**Template:** [Download here](computer:///mnt/user-data/outputs/Lab-5-COMPLETE-WITH-ANALYTICS/templates/final-problem-statement-template.md)  
**Time:** 90-120 minutes  
**Worth:** 8 points

**What to include:**
- **Your problem statement** following the template:
  > "[Specific user segment] [lose/waste/experience] [quantified impact] because [root cause] [in context], leading to [consequences]."
  
- **8+ supporting quotes** from your interviews
- **Decision:** Did you KEEP, REFINE, or PIVOT from your Week 2 problem?
- **Confidence assessment:** How sure are you this is the right problem?

**Example problem statement:**
> "KIU CS students working on group projects miss 30-40% of milestones because they lack shared visibility into task ownership and deadlines across fragmented tools (LMS, WhatsApp, Discord), leading to last-minute scrambles, duplicated work, and grade penalties."

**What makes a GOOD problem statement:**
- ‚úÖ Specific user segment (not "students" but "KIU CS students in group projects")
- ‚úÖ Quantified impact (30-40% of milestones, not just "struggle")
- ‚úÖ Root cause identified (lack of visibility, not "are confused")
- ‚úÖ Context specified (group projects, not "always")
- ‚úÖ Real consequences (grade penalties, not "annoyed")

**Tips:**
- Every claim should cite specific interviews: "Validated by P001, P002, P003..."
- Include powerful verbatim quotes that support your statement
- Be honest about your confidence level - if you're not sure, say why
- If pivoting, explain clearly why your original problem wasn't validated

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
‚ùå Too vague: "Students have trouble with organization"  
‚ùå Not quantified: "Students waste time" (how much time?)  
‚ùå No context: "Students can't find study spots" (when? where? which students?)  
‚ùå Weak evidence: Only citing 3-4 interviews instead of 8+

---

## üìä Part B: Analytics (5-6 hours)

### Why Analytics Matters

You validated your problem. Now you need to know:
- **Did we solve it?** (Need metrics to measure success)
- **Are people using our solution?** (Need events to track behavior)
- **What's working and what's not?** (Need dashboard to see data)

Without analytics, you're building blind. You won't know if your MVP actually helps.

---

### Deliverable 4: North Star Metric

**File:** `/02-analytics/north-star-metric.md`  
**Template:** [Download here](computer:///mnt/user-data/outputs/Lab-5-COMPLETE-WITH-ANALYTICS/templates/north-star-metric-template.md)  
**Time:** 45-60 minutes  
**Worth:** 3 points

**What to include:**
- **Your North Star Metric:** The ONE number that shows your product is working
- **Why this metric:** How it connects to your problem statement
- **Targets:** What "good" looks like (MVP target)
- **How you'll measure it:** Which events power this metric

**Example:**
- **NSM:** Weekly Active Study Sessions Completed
- **Why:** Each completed session means a student used our unified system instead of bouncing between 4+ tools, directly addressing our validated problem
- **MVP Target:** 100 sessions/week by end of Week 8
- **How:** Track `study_session_completed` events

**What makes a GOOD North Star Metric:**
- ‚úÖ Measures VALUE delivery (not vanity like total signups)
- ‚úÖ Connected to your problem statement
- ‚úÖ Predicts long-term success
- ‚úÖ Everyone on your team can understand it

**Tips:**
- Think about the "aha moment" when users experience your value
- Don't pick something easy to measure - pick what MATTERS
- Your NSM should go up if you're solving the problem

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
‚ùå Picking vanity metrics: "Total users" tells you nothing about value  
‚ùå Too complex: If you need a calculator to explain it, it's wrong  
‚ùå Not connected to problem: If NSM goes up but problem still exists, wrong metric

---

### Deliverable 5: Event Schema

**File:** `/02-analytics/event-schema.md`  
**Template:** [Download here](computer:///mnt/user-data/outputs/Lab-5-COMPLETE-WITH-ANALYTICS/templates/event-schema-template.md)  
**Time:** 60-90 minutes  
**Worth:** 4 points

**What to include:**
- **6-10 core events** you'll track in your MVP
- **Event naming convention:** `object_action` format (e.g., `study_session_started`)
- **Properties for each event:** What data you'll capture
- **Event-to-metric mapping:** How events power your NSM

**Example events:**
1. `user_signup_completed` - When account is created
2. `study_session_started` - When user creates a session
3. `study_session_completed` - When user finishes a session
4. `resource_shared` - When user shares materials
5. `invite_sent` - When user invites others
6. `user_logged_in` - Daily active usage

**Event properties example:**
```json
{
  "event_name": "study_session_completed",
  "user_id": "user_12345",
  "session_id": "session_67890",
  "session_type": "group",
  "subject": "mathematics",
  "duration_minutes": 45,
  "participants_count": 4,
  "timestamp": "2025-10-30T14:23:45Z"
}
```

**Tips:**
- Start with AARRR framework (Acquisition ‚Üí Activation ‚Üí Retention ‚Üí Referral ‚Üí Revenue)
- Each stage needs at least 1 event
- Include properties that help you understand WHY things happen
- Follow the naming convention strictly (makes data analysis easier later)

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
‚ùå Too many events: 6-10 is enough for MVP, don't try to track everything  
‚ùå Inconsistent naming: `SessionStart` vs `session_started` vs `start_session`  
‚ùå Missing properties: You'll wish you captured more context later  
‚ùå Including PII: Never track emails, phone numbers, or names in events

### Deliverable 6: Analytics Implementation Plan

**File:** `/02-analytics/analytics-plan.md`  
**Template:** [Download here](computer:///mnt/user-data/outputs/Lab-5-COMPLETE-WITH-ANALYTICS/templates/analytics-plan-template.md)  
**Time:** 90-120 minutes  
**Worth:** 5 points

**What to include:**
- **Technology stack:** What tools you'll use (Segment? Mixpanel? Custom?)
- **Architecture diagram:** How data flows from app ‚Üí dashboard
- **Implementation timeline:** Week-by-week plan for Weeks 6-8
- **Dashboard design:** What your team will look at weekly
- **Team responsibilities:** Who implements what

**Week-by-week plan example:**
- **Week 6:** Set up analytics platform, implement first 2 events
- **Week 7:** Implement remaining events, build basic dashboard
- **Week 8:** Deploy to production, monitor, train team

**Tips:**
- Keep it simple for MVP - you can always upgrade later
- Free tiers are fine (Segment free, Google Analytics, etc.)
- Focus on your NSM dashboard first, fancy stuff later
- Make sure every team member knows what to build

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
‚ùå Over-engineering: You don't need a data warehouse for MVP  
‚ùå No timeline: "We'll figure it out" won't work  
‚ùå Vague responsibilities: Everyone owns it = no one owns it  
‚ùå Forgetting testing: Plan time to verify events actually fire

## üö® Common Pitfalls

### Synthesis Mistakes:

**‚ùå "We only did 6 interviews"**  
‚Üí You need 8+ for strong patterns. Do 2-4 more this weekend.

**‚ùå "Our problem statement is too vague"**  
‚Üí Add specifics: WHO exactly, WHAT failure, HOW MUCH impact, WHEN/WHERE context

**‚ùå "We're forcing data to fit our original idea"**  
‚Üí Follow the evidence. If interviews don't validate your problem, PIVOT.

**‚ùå "We can't agree on the problem"**  
‚Üí Use data to decide. Which statement has more supporting interviews?

### Analytics Mistakes:

**‚ùå "Our NSM is total signups"**  
‚Üí That's vanity. Pick something that measures VALUE delivery.

**‚ùå "We're tracking 20 events"**  
‚Üí Too many. Start with 6-10 core events. Add more later.

**‚ùå "We'll figure out implementation later"**  
‚Üí No. You need a concrete plan NOW so Week 6 build includes analytics.

**‚ùå "We don't know what tools to use"**  
‚Üí Start simple: Segment (free), Google Analytics, or custom DB logging.

## üí° Pro Tips

### For Synthesis:

1. **Trust the process:** Affinity mapping feels chaotic at first. Keep going.
2. **Be specific:** "KIU CS students in group projects" > "students"
3. **Quote obsessively:** Every claim should reference specific interviews
4. **Embrace pivots:** Discovering your original problem is wrong = SUCCESS

### For Analytics:

1. **Think about the "aha moment":** When does a user first get value? That's your NSM.
2. **Start simple:** You can always add more events later. Start with 6-10.
3. **Test early:** In Week 6, implement analytics FIRST, then features.
4. **Make it visible:** If the team doesn't look at the dashboard, analytics is worthless.

### General:

1. **Start early:** Don't wait until Thursday night. This is 10 hours of work.
2. **Divide and conquer:** Split templates among team members, then review together.
3. **Use office hours:** Stuck? Come to office hours Tues/Thurs 2-4 PM.
4. **Cite everything:** When in doubt, add more interview citations.

## üéì Why This Matters

This is the **most important homework** of the semester. Here's why:

**Without good synthesis:**
- You might build a solution to a problem nobody has
- You won't know if your problem is real or assumed
- You'll waste 10 weeks building the wrong thing

**Without good analytics:**
- You won't know if your solution actually works
- You can't measure success or improvement
- You'll make decisions based on guesses, not data

**Get both right:**
- You build what people actually need
- You can measure if it's working
- You can iterate and improve based on real data
- Demo Day goes well because you have PROOF your solution works
