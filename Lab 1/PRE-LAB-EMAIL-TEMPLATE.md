**Subject:** Lab 1 This Friday: Team Formation & Problem Discovery - Action Required

---

Hi everyone,

Lab 1 is this Friday, and we're hitting the ground running. This week you'll form your teams, pick a problem worth solving, and set up for success. **But first, you have pre-work due Thursday.**

---

## 📋 PRE-LAB WORK (Due Thursday 11:59 PM)

**You must complete these 3 things BEFORE Friday's lab:**

### 1. Read: "The Mom Test" Introduction (15 pages)
📄 **PDF link:** [Add link to syllabus/course materials]

This teaches you how to interview users without getting polite lies. You'll use this skill for the entire semester.

**Key takeaway:** Talk about their life, not your idea.

---

### 2. Watch: Jobs To Be Done Framework (8 minutes)
🎥 **Video:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84LymEs67Y

Understand why people "hire" products to get jobs done.

**Key takeaway:** People don't want features—they want to make progress.

---

### 3. Submit: 3 Problem Ideas via Google Form
📝 **Form link:** [Insert Google Form URL]

Think about frustrations you or others experience regularly. Be specific!

**Examples:**
- ✅ "I waste 20 minutes daily finding parking because I can't see which lots are full"
- ❌ "Students need better apps" (too vague)

**Deadline: Thursday 11:59 PM** ⏰

---

## 🎯 WHAT TO EXPECT IN FRIDAY'S LAB (60 minutes)

### You'll be doing 4 things:

**Part 1: Team Formation (15 min)**
- I've assigned you to balanced teams based on your surveys
- You'll meet your teammates and establish ground rules
- Create your team working agreement (contract)

**Part 2: Problem Selection (20 min)**  
- Your team will evaluate all submitted problem ideas
- Filter using 4 criteria (pain level, access, feasibility, energy)
- Pick ONE problem to pursue

**Part 3: Define Your User (15 min)**
- Create an Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)
- Figure out WHO specifically has this problem
- Identify WHERE to find them for interviews

**Part 4: Plan Next Steps (10 min)**
- Outline your interview strategy
- Know who you're talking to next week

---

## 📚 AFTER LAB: Homework Preview

**Individual work (Due Monday):**
- Draft 10 interview questions using The Mom Test principles
- No hypotheticals ("would you use...") allowed!

**Team work (Due Tuesday):**
- Refine your ICP based on lab feedback
- Post recruitment messages in 2+ channels

## 🎒 BRING TO LAB

- [ ] Laptop (charged, GitHub access working)
- [ ] Your 3 submitted problem ideas (pulled up)
- [ ] Pen and paper for notes
- [ ] Willingness to make quick decisions!

---

## 🚨 IMPORTANT NOTES

### Team Assignments
I've created 4 balanced teams (1 team of 5, 3 teams of 4) based on your survey responses. You'll see your assignment posted in the class channel on Friday morning.

**Team formation factors:**
- Skill diversity (eng, product, design)
- Experience mix (builders + learners)  
- Motivation balance (requirement fulfilment + startup enthusiasts)

Trust the process—there's a method to this.

### Lab Pace
This lab will feel fast. That's intentional. You'll make decisions with incomplete information, just like real product teams. Don't overthink—done is better than perfect.

### Get Help Early
If you're stuck on pre-work, post in `#lab-help` channel or DM me. Don't wait until Thursday night!

## 💡 PRO TIPS

1. **Do pre-work early** - Don't wait until Thursday night
2. **Be specific with problems** - "Students waste 20 min daily..." beats "time management is hard"
3. **Come with ideas, not solutions** - We're discovering problems, not pitching products (yet)
4. **Engage in lab** - The teams that collaborate well here succeed all semester
