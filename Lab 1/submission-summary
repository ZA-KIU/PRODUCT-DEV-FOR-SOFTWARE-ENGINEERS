## ⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

### Pre-Lab
- ❌ Submitting vague problem ideas ("improve education")
- ❌ Not actually doing the reading (you'll struggle in lab)

### In-Lab
- ❌ Rushing through team contract (it matters!)
- ❌ Choosing problem based on "cool factor" not validation criteria
- ❌ ICP too broad ("students" is not specific enough)
- ❌ Forgetting to commit files to repo

### Homework
- ❌ Interview questions that pitch your solution
- ❌ Using "would you" or hypothetical questions
- ❌ Generic outreach message (low response rate)
- ❌ Waiting until last minute to schedule interviews

---

## 🆘 IF YOU'RE STUCK

### Team Contract Issues
- Can't agree on decision rule? → Try "simple majority with escalation clause"
- Unclear on roles? → Start with 3 core roles, add more if needed
- Conflict on meeting times? → Use when2meet or Doodle poll

### Problem Selection Issues
- Can't narrow down? → Vote using 4 criteria, then discuss top 2
- No problems pass filters? → Your standards might be too high; some uncertainty is okay
- Team disagrees? → Use your team contract's decision rule

### ICP Issues
- Too broad? → Add one more specific constraint each time
- Can't find channels? → Think: Where do these people already gather?
- Not sure about pain intensity? → Mark it as assumption to test in interviews

### Interview Questions Issues
- Questions feel awkward? → Practice with teammate; natural flow comes with rehearsal
- Keep wanting to pitch? → Reframe: You're a student of their experience
- Stuck on Mom Test principles? → Reread chapter 1; watch example videos again

### Outreach Issues
- No responses? → Message might be too formal; make it conversational
- Wrong people responding? → ICP might be off; refine targeting
- Can't find channels? → Start with friends, ask for intros

## 📞 GETTING HELP

1. **Team-level issues:** Use your team contract's escalation process
2. **Technical questions:** Post in `#lab-help` channel
3. **Conceptual questions:** Attend office hours or post in `#questions`
4. **Urgent blockers:** DM instructor (response within 24 hrs)

## 💪 FINAL PRE-FLIGHT CHECK

**Before you consider Lab 1 "done," ask yourself:**

- [ ] Can I explain our problem statement to someone in 10 seconds?
- [ ] Could I recognize our ICP if they walked into a room?
- [ ] Do I know exactly where to find 10 of them?
- [ ] Are my interview questions based on past behavior, not hypotheticals?
- [ ] Have we actually posted our outreach message (not just drafted it)?
- [ ] Is our team contract specific enough to actually use when conflicts arise?
- [ ] Do I feel confident conducting my first interview?

**If you answered "no" to any of these, revisit that section before submitting.**

## 🎯 REMEMBER

> "Perfect is the enemy of done.  
> Done is the enemy of learning.  
> Learning is the goal."

Your Lab 1 submissions are **starting points**, not final products. We EXPECT you to revise your ICP after interviews. We WANT you to discover your problem statement was wrong.

**The purpose of this lab is to set you up to learn effectively, not to have all the answers.**

**Now go build something worth building. 🚀**
