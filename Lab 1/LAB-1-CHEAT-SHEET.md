[Specific user segment] + 
waste/lose/miss [quantified impact] + 
[specific context] + 
because [root cause] +

**❌ BAD:** "Students need better apps"

---

## 🎯 THE MOM TEST - 3 RULES

### Rule 1: Talk about THEIR life, not YOUR idea
❌ "Would you use an app that..."  
✅ "Tell me about the last time you..."

### Rule 2: Ask about PAST behavior, not future hypotheticals  
❌ "Would you pay for this?"  
✅ "What do you currently spend money on for this?"

### Rule 3: LISTEN more than you talk (80/20 rule)
- They talk: 80%
- You talk: 20%

## 🔍 4 PROBLEM FILTERS

| Filter | Question | Pass/Fail |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| 🔥 **Hair on Fire** | Real pain or mild annoyance? | Is it urgent? |
| 👥 **Access** | Can find 10+ people? | Can you reach them? |
| 🛠️ **Feasibility** | MVP in 8-10 weeks? | Can you build it? |
| ⚡ **Energy** | Excites 3/4 of team? | Will you stay motivated? |

**All 4 must be YES to proceed.**

## 👤 ICP ESSENTIALS

**Must know:**
1. **WHO exactly** (age, year, major, living situation)
2. **PAIN level** (frequency, intensity, impact)  
3. **WHERE to find them** (3+ specific channels)

**The test:**  
Could you identify this person in a room and know where to find 10 of them?

---

## ❓ INTERVIEW QUESTION TYPES

### ✅ DO ASK:
- "Walk me through the last time..."
- "What did you do when..."
- "How did that make you feel?"
- "What have you tried before?"
- "Who else has this problem?"

### ❌ DON'T ASK:
- "Would you use..."
- "Do you think..."
- "If we built..."
- "Wouldn't it be great if..."
- Anything that requires them to predict the future

---

## 📋 TEAM CONTRACT MUST-HAVES

1. **Roles:** Who owns what (names, not "someone")
2. **Decisions:** How we decide when we disagree
3. **Conflicts:** 4-level escalation path
4. **Meetings:** EXACT times (not "regularly")
5. **Communication:** Response time expectations
6. **Tracking:** How we measure contribution
7. **Signatures:** All team members sign

**Be specific:** "Tuesdays 4 PM" not "we'll meet sometimes"

---

## 🚨 RED FLAGS

### Your problem is weak if:
- ❌ Can't name 10 specific people who have it
- ❌ People say "it's not that bad"
- ❌ No one's tried to solve it before
- ❌ Can't quantify the impact

### Your ICP is too vague if:
- ❌ Just says "students" or "users"
- ❌ No clear access channels
- ❌ You can't visualize them

### Your questions are bad if:
- ❌ They include "would you..."
- ❌ You're pitching your solution
- ❌ They're all generic
- ❌ No follow-up prompts
