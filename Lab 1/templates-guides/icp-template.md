# IDEAL CUSTOMER PROFILE (ICP) - SAMPLE

**‚ö†Ô∏è This is an EXAMPLE showing what a well-developed ICP looks like. Use for reference, not copy-paste.**

---

**Version:** Draft 2 (revised after 5 interviews)  
**Date:** October 8, 2025  
**Team:** Discovery Engine  
**Problem Focus:** Study spot discovery for commuter students

---

## üìç Problem Statement

**Problem:** KIU commuter students waste 15-20 minutes per day finding quiet study spots with power outlets between classes during peak hours (10 AM - 2 PM) because real-time occupancy information isn't available, causing them to miss productive study time and feel stressed about falling behind on coursework.

---

## üë§ Target Segment

### Demographics
- **Age range:** 19-22 years old
- **Academic year/status:** 2nd and 3rd year students (who have consistent class schedules)
- **Major/field of study:** Primarily CS, Engineering, Business (heavy reading/assignment load)
- **Living situation:** 
  - [x] On-campus housing
  - [x] Off-campus (commute < 30 min)
  - [x] Off-campus (commute > 30 min) ‚Üê **Primary focus**
  - [ ] Other

**Why commuters?** They can't go home between classes, so campus study time is critical. They also often arrive early (to avoid traffic) and have forced gaps in their schedule.

### Psychographics
- **Motivation/goals:** 
  - Maintain GPA above 3.5 (many have scholarship requirements)
  - Use time on campus efficiently (every hour counts)
  - Avoid taking work home (want separation between school/home)
  
- **Values:** 
  - Efficiency (time is precious)
  - Predictability (hate surprises, like finding library full)
  - Autonomy (want to control their own schedule)

- **Constraints:** 
  - **Time:** Have 1-2 hour gaps between classes, can't waste 15+ min searching
  - **Location:** Limited to on-campus spots (can't go to nearby cafes)
  - **Resources:** Need power for laptop, stable WiFi for online assignments
  - **Schedule:** Peak study times (10 AM - 2 PM) coincide with peak library occupancy

---

## üî• The Pain Point

### Primary Pain
**Specific description:**  
Students arrive on campus 30-60 minutes before first class (to avoid traffic) or have 1-2 hour gaps between classes. They need a quiet place with power outlets and WiFi to work on assignments. They currently walk to 3-4 different locations (library, student center, department study rooms) before finding an available spot. This wastes 15-20 minutes and by the time they sit down, they've lost momentum and feel frustrated.

**Frequency:** 
- [x] Multiple times per day (for students with gaps)
- [x] Daily (most weekdays)
- [ ] Few times per week
- [ ] Weekly

**Specifics:** 
- Happens 3-5 times per week
- Most acute on Tuesdays/Thursdays (heavy class days)
- Worst during midterms and finals (library even fuller)

**Intensity:** (1-10, where 10 is "hair on fire")  
**Rating:** 7-8 / 10

**Why this score:**
- Not life-threatening, but significantly impacts academic performance
- Creates daily stress and anxiety
- Direct consequence (missed deadlines, lower grades)
- Has ripple effects (take work home, sacrifice sleep)

**Impact:**

**Time wasted:** 
- 15-20 min per search √ó 3-4 times/week = 45-80 min/week
- Over 15 weeks semester = 11-20 hours total wasted time

**Money wasted:** 
- None directly, but time = money for students working part-time
- Potential scholarship loss if GPA drops

**Emotional toll:** 
- Frustration ("I'm already stressed, this adds to it")
- Anxiety ("What if I can't find a spot today?")
- Guilt ("I should be studying, not walking around")
- Exhaustion (decision fatigue from this happening daily)

**Other consequences:** 
- Taking unfinished work home (when they wanted school/life separation)
- Studying in suboptimal locations (noisy cafeteria, dead laptop battery)
- Arriving late to next class (still looking when class starts)
- Lower quality work (rushed because time wasted searching)

### Triggering Context
**When this problem occurs:**

**When:** 
- Weekday mornings: 8:30-10 AM (early arrivals before class)
- Midday: 11 AM-2 PM (between-class gaps)
- Peak days: Tuesdays and Thursdays (most class schedules)
- Worst times: Weeks 4-6, 10-12 (exam periods)

**Where:** 
- Main library (first stop for 90% of students)
- Department study lounges (second option)
- Student center quiet areas (third option)
- Empty classrooms (last resort, often kicked out)

**What's happening:** 
Student finishes morning class or arrives early to campus. Has 60-90 minutes before next obligation. Needs to make progress on CS assignment or reading. Walks to library ‚Üí all tables taken. Walks to CS lounge ‚Üí also full. Tries student center ‚Üí noisy. Ends up in cafeteria with dead laptop battery or goes to car (uncomfortable, wastes gas for AC).

**Example scenario from interview #3:**
> "I have a 9 AM class, then nothing until 12. I get to campus at 8:30 to beat traffic. I want to use that time for my programming assignment. I go to library first‚Äîevery table taken. I check CS study room‚Äî3 people per desk, too crowded. I end up in the cafeteria but it's so loud I can't think. I try to code but get distracted. By 10:30 I've barely made progress and I'm already mentally exhausted. Then I have to go to my next class. The whole morning feels wasted."

## üõ†Ô∏è Current Behavior & Workarounds

### What They Do Today

**Current solution(s):**

1. **The Circuit Walk** (85% of interviewees)
   - Walk to library first (always)
   - If full, walk to department study area
   - If full, walk to student center
   - If all full, settle for suboptimal (cafeteria, car, outside bench)
   - **Time cost:** 15-20 minutes
   - **Success rate:** ~60% (find "okay" spot, not ideal)

2. **The Early Bird Strategy** (40%)
   - Arrive to campus 45-60 min before actually needed
   - Rush to library as soon as they arrive
   - "Claim" a spot for the whole day (leave bag/laptop)
   - **Pro:** Guarantees spot
   - **Con:** Tied to one location all day, can't be flexible

3. **The Friend Network** (35%)
   - Text friends: "Is library full?"
   - Ask someone to "save a seat"
   - Hope for real-time info
   - **Pro:** Sometimes works
   - **Con:** Friends aren't always there, info becomes outdated by time they arrive

4. **The Favorites List** (25%)
   - Keep mental list of "backup spots" 
   - Skip library entirely, go straight to less popular spots
   - **Pro:** Higher success rate
   - **Con:** Spots are less ideal (noisier, no power, farther from next class)

5. **The Give Up Approach** (15%)
   - After 2-3 failed attempts, just go to car or skip studying
   - Do work at home later (defeats purpose of studying on campus)
   - **Most frustrated segment**

### Why current solutions fail:

1. **The Circuit Walk:**
   - Wastes 15-20 min they could be studying
   - By the time they sit, they're frustrated and unfocused
   - No guarantee of finding a spot

2. **Early Bird:**
   - Forces them to arrive earlier than needed (more commute time)
   - Locked to one spot all day (can't optimize for each class)
   - People take their spot when they leave for class

3. **Friend Network:**
   - Relies on friends being there (unreliable)
   - Info is often outdated ("was empty 20 min ago, now full")
   - Friends get annoyed by constant "is it full?" texts

4. **Favorites List:**
   - Compromise on study quality (noise, comfort, proximity)
   - "Backup" spots fill up too as word spreads
   - Still involves walking to check

5. **Give Up:**
   - Defeats the whole purpose
   - Creates guilt and stress
   - Academic performance suffers

### What they've tried before:

**Tools attempted:**
- Google Maps (shows library location, not occupancy)
- University's "study spaces" website (static info, often outdated)
- Discord "is library full?" posts (delayed responses, not real-time)

**Hacks/Workarounds:**
- Peeking through library windows from outside (still requires walking there)
- Calling friends inside library (awkward, unreliable)
- Memorizing "usual" empty times (patterns break during exams)

**Gave up on:**
- Booking study rooms (requires 24hr advance notice, too inflexible)
- Staying in empty classrooms (get kicked out, unreliable)
- Studying at nearby cafes (costs money, need to commute again)

## üéØ Jobs To Be Done (JTBD)

### Functional Job

**When I** arrive on campus between classes with 60-90 minutes of free time and urgent assignments due  
**I want to** immediately know where I can find a quiet study spot with power outlets and WiFi within a 3-minute walk of my location  
**So I can** maximize productive study time without wasting 15+ minutes searching or settling for suboptimal locations

### Emotional Job
**What solving this makes them feel:**
- [x] In control (of their time and schedule)
- [x] Confident (that they'll find a spot)
- [x] Relieved (one less source of daily stress)
- [x] Productive (can dive right into work)
- [ ] Connected

**Emotional transformation:**
- FROM: Anxious, frustrated, reactive ("hope I find something")
- TO: Calm, efficient, proactive ("I know exactly where to go")

### Social Job
**How this affects their standing/perception:**

Not a major social job, but minor elements:
- Appear organized to peers (not wandering around looking lost)
- Maintain image as "responsible student" (not scrambling last minute)
- Avoid looking desperate (asking everyone "is library full?")

**Primary job = Functional + Emotional, not social**

## üìä Validation Metrics

### How will we know this ICP is correct?

**Must validate:**
- [x] Can find 10+ people matching this profile  
  ‚Üí *Status: Found 18 so far, scheduled 12 interviews*

- [x] They acknowledge the problem without prompting  
  ‚Üí *Status: 9/10 immediately said "yes! library is always full"*

- [x] Problem occurs with stated frequency  
  ‚Üí *Status: Confirmed. 3-5 times per week for most*

- [x] They're actively seeking solutions (or have given up)  
  ‚Üí *Status: All have tried workarounds. 2 have given up and study at home*

- [x] They have budget/authority to adopt a solution  
  ‚Üí *Status: If it's free app, yes. Not willing to pay >$5/month*

### Red flags we're watching for:

- [ ] Can't find enough people matching profile ‚Üí Too narrow  
  ‚Üí *Not a concern. Easy to find commuters*

- [ ] People don't relate to the problem ‚Üí Wrong pain point  
  ‚Üí *Not seen yet. 90% relate immediately*

- [ ] Problem is "nice to have" not "must have" ‚Üí Low intensity  
  ‚Üí *Monitoring. Seems urgent for most, but 2/10 said "I've learned to deal with it"*

- [ ] Current workarounds are "good enough" ‚Üí No real need  
  ‚Üí *Some are "okay" with workarounds, but still frustrated. Room for improvement*

### Validation status (After 10 interviews):

‚úÖ **Confirmed:**
- Problem is real and frequent (9/10 experience it)
- Occurs during stated times (peak hours 10-2)
- Current solutions are inadequate
- Emotional toll is significant (stress, frustration)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Still exploring:**
- Willingness to adopt new solution (need to test with prototype)
- Whether they'll change behavior (might stick with familiar workarounds)
- If real-time data is THE solution vs. just A solution

‚ùå **Invalidated:**
- Initial assumption: Only library matters  
  ‚Üí *Actually, they check 3-4 locations. Need multi-building data*
- Initial assumption: All commuters have same pain  
  ‚Üí *Those with 3+ hour gaps don't feel urgent. Focus on 1-2 hour gaps*

## üé≠ Persona Snapshot

**Meet "Commuter Anna"** (Composite based on interviews #2, #5, #8)

**Age:** 21, 3rd year CS student  
**Lives:** 35 minutes from campus (with parents)  
**Schedule:** Classes Tues/Thurs 9 AM, 12 PM, 3 PM (forced 2-hour gaps)

**Quote:**  
*"I drive 35 minutes to get here, and then I waste another 20 minutes just walking around looking for somewhere to sit. By the time I actually start working, I'm already exhausted. It's like, why did I even bother coming early?"*

**A day in her life:**

**Morning (7:30 AM):** 
- Wakes up, 30 min to get ready, leaves at 8 AM to avoid traffic
- Arrives at campus 8:35 AM (has class at 9 AM)
- Wants to use 25 min to review notes, but where?

**Midday (10:00 AM):**
- Class ends, has until 12 PM (2 hours free)
- Needs to work on programming assignment (requires focus + power)
- Tries library (full), CS lounge (full), ends up in cafeteria (noisy)
- Gets halfway through assignment, frustrated, can't concentrate

**Afternoon (3:30 PM):**
- Last class ends, heads home
- Finishes assignment at home at 10 PM (wanted to keep school/home separate)
- Frustrated that campus time was wasted

**Tech she uses:**
- **Apps:** Discord, Google Calendar, Drive, Spotify
- **Devices:** MacBook Pro (needs charging), iPhone
- **Comfort level:** [x] High - Very tech-savvy, early adopter

**Buying power:**
- [ ] Can spend their own money (limited budget, part-time job)
- [x] Would need approval from parents (for anything >$10/month)
- [x] Prefers free, will pay for major value (~$3-5/month max)

**Pain points ranked:**
1. Wasting time searching (biggest frustration)
2. Uncertainty (not knowing before arrival)
3. Suboptimal spots (noisy, no power)
4. Disrupted flow (by time she sits, lost momentum)

**What would make her day better:**
"If I could just check my phone before I even park and know exactly which building has spots, I'd save so much time and stress. That's literally all I need."

## üîÑ Iteration Log

### Draft 1 ‚Üí Draft 2 Changes
**Date:** October 8, 2025

**What we learned (from first 5 interviews):**
- Not just library‚Äîstudents check 3-4 locations
- Commute time matters (30+ min commuters feel this more)
- It's not just about finding "a" spot, it's finding spot with power + quiet
- Emotional toll is higher than expected (affects whole day)

**What we changed:**
- **Narrowed:** From "all students" to "commuter students with 1-2 hr gaps"
- **Expanded problem:** From "library occupancy" to "campus-wide study spot discovery"
- **Added context:** Specific buildings, specific times, specific requirements
- **Quantified better:** 15-20 min waste (was "some time"), 3-5x per week (was "often")

### Draft 2 ‚Üí Draft 3 Changes
**Date:** TBD (after next 5 interviews)

Will explore:
- Do shorter gaps (< 1 hour) have different needs?
- Are graduate students also affected? (different ICP?)
- Does this change during exam periods? (seasonal variation)
