# The Mom Test - Quick Reference Guide

## 📖 Core Concept

**The Mom Test Rule:**  
*Talk about their life instead of your idea.*

The book is called "The Mom Test" because the only way to get honest feedback - even from your mom who loves you and wants to make you happy - is to focus the conversation on their experiences, not your ideas.

## 🎯 The Three Rules

### Rule 1: Talk about their life, not your idea
**Don't say:** "I'm building an app to help students find study spots. Would you use it?"  
**Instead ask:** "Tell me about the last time you needed to find a place to study on campus. What did you do?"

**Why it works:** People lie about future behavior to be polite. But they can't lie about what already happened.

---

### Rule 2: Ask about specifics in the past, not generics or opinions about the future
**Don't say:** "Do you usually struggle to find study spots?"  
**Instead ask:** "Walk me through what happened the last three times you looked for a study spot. What did you do each time?"

**Why it works:** Generic answers give you generic (useless) data. Specific stories reveal patterns and emotions.

---

### Rule 3: Talk less and listen more
**Don't:** Fill silences with your explanations  
**Instead:** After they answer, count to 3 before speaking. Use follow-ups like "Tell me more about that..."

**Why it works:** The best insights come after awkward pauses when people think deeper and share what REALLY matters.

## ✅ Good Questions vs ❌ Bad Questions

### Opening Questions

❌ **Bad:** "Do you like our idea?"  
✅ **Good:** "Tell me about your typical day. Walk me through it."

❌ **Bad:** "Would this solve your problem?"  
✅ **Good:** "What's the hardest part about [relevant situation]?"

### Digging Deeper

❌ **Bad:** "Would you pay for a solution to this?"  
✅ **Good:** "What do you currently spend money on to deal with this?"

❌ **Bad:** "Is this a big problem for you?"  
✅ **Good:** "When was the last time this came up? What did you do?"

### Understanding Current Solutions

❌ **Bad:** "What features would you want?"  
✅ **Good:** "Show me how you currently do this. Walk me through your process."

❌ **Bad:** "Why don't you use [competitor]?"  
✅ **Good:** "Have you tried other solutions? What happened with those?"

### Closing Questions

❌ **Bad:** "Would you sign up for our beta?"  
✅ **Good:** "Who else deals with this problem? Could you introduce me?"

## 🚫 Questions to Avoid Entirely

### The Hypothetical
- "Would you use X?"
- "If we built Y, would you pay for it?"  
- "Do you think Z is a good idea?"

**Why they fail:** People are terrible at predicting their own behavior. They'll say yes to be nice.

### The Pitch in Disguise
- "We're building a platform that helps students find study spots. What do you think?"
- "Our solution does X, Y, and Z. Does that sound useful?"

**Why they fail:** You're asking them to validate you, not teach you.

### The Generic Waste of Time
- "What are your biggest problems?"
- "What do you struggle with as a student?"
- "How do you feel about education?"

**Why they fail:** Too broad. You'll get surface-level answers that won't help you build anything.

### The Leading Question
- "Don't you hate it when X happens?"
- "Wouldn't it be great if Y existed?"
- "Isn't Z really frustrating?"

**Why they fail:** You're putting words in their mouth. They'll just agree with you.

## 🔬 Validating Vs. Learning

### You're Seeking Validation When:
- You explain your idea in detail
- You ask if they like it
- You get excited when they say yes
- You ignore their hesitations
- You talk more than they do

### You're Learning When:
- They do most of the talking
- You ask about their past behavior
- You dig into their "no" responses
- You find problems with your assumptions
- You leave with more questions than answers

## 🚨 Warning Signs

### Red Flags During Interviews
- They keep asking about your solution → You're pitching, not learning
- They're being overly positive → They're being polite, not honest
- You're explaining a lot → You've lost control of the conversation
- They can't give specific examples → Problem might not be real for them
- They say "I would definitely use this" → That's a compliment, not commitment

### Green Flags During Interviews  
- They immediately relate to the problem → It's real and frequent
- They show emotion when describing pain → It matters to them
- They have multiple specific stories → Pattern of behavior
- They've tried other solutions → They're actively seeking help
- They offer to introduce you to others → Problem is common

## 💡 Pro Tips for Better Interviews

### 1. Embrace Silence
After they answer, count to 3. The best insights often come in that pause.

### 2. The Power of "Why?"
When they state something, dig deeper:
- "Why did you do it that way?"
- "Why was that important?"
- "Why didn't the other solution work?"

### 3. Watch for "Anchors"
When they say "I usually do X," ask:
- "What made you start doing it that way?"
- "When doesn't that work?"
- "Have you tried anything else?"

### 4. Note the Energy
Pay attention to:
- What lights them up?
- What makes them frustrated?  
- What do they dismiss as "not a big deal"?

Energy reveals importance better than words.

### 5. The Rule of Three
Ask about the last THREE times something happened. Patterns emerge. One-offs are revealed.

- ✅ Find real, painful problems
- ✅ Learn how they currently cope
- ✅ Discover what they truly value
- ✅ Find more people to talk to

## 📚 Key Takeaways

1. **Your idea doesn't matter (yet).** What matters is understanding your users' lives.

2. **Compliments are dangerous.** "That's a great idea!" tells you nothing. "Here's what I do today" tells you everything.

3. **Past behavior > Future promises.** What they've done is truth. What they say they'll do is fiction.

4. **Specifics reveal truth.** Generic answers are polite deflections. Specific stories are goldmines.

5. **Your job is to learn, not to convince.** Go in assuming you know nothing (because you don't).

## 🔄 Quick Self-Check

Before your interview:
- [ ] Do I have questions about THEIR life, not MY idea?
- [ ] Am I asking about PAST behavior, not future hypotheticals?
- [ ] Am I prepared to LISTEN, not pitch?

After your interview:
- [ ] Did I learn about their world?
- [ ] Do I have specific stories, not opinions?
- [ ] Did I discover something surprising?
- [ ] Am I less confident in my assumptions?

**If you answered no to any of these, you're doing The Mom Test wrong. That's okay—it takes practice. Do better next time.**
