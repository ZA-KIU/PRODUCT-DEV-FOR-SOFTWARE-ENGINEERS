# Jobs To Be Done (JTBD) Framework Guide

## 🎯 What is Jobs To Be Done?

**Core Idea:**  
People don't buy products—they "hire" them to get a job done.

When someone uses your product, they're not interested in features. They're trying to make progress in their life. Understanding the "job" they're hiring your product for is the key to building something people actually want.

## 🔧 The JTBD Statement Format

### Standard Template

```
When I [situation/context],
I want to [motivation/goal],
So I can [desired outcome/benefit].
```

### Breaking It Down

**When I [situation/context]**
- The triggering event or circumstance
- The specific context when the need arises
- Time, place, emotional state

**I want to [motivation/goal]**
- The immediate objective
- What they're trying to accomplish
- The functional need

**So I can [desired outcome/benefit]**
- The ultimate benefit
- Why the goal matters
- The emotional or social payoff

## 📋 Examples: Good vs Bad

### ❌ Bad JTBD Statements

**Too Solution-Focused:**
> "When I'm on campus, I want to use an app to find study spots, so I can study efficiently."

*Problem: Assumes the solution (an app). Focuses on features, not the real job.*

**Too Vague:**
> "When I'm stressed, I want to feel better, so I can be happy."

*Problem: No specific context, motivation is generic, outcome is unclear.*

**Too Narrow:**
> "When it's 3 PM on Tuesday, I want to find a library seat, so I can sit down."

*Problem: Overly specific situation, shallow motivation, obvious outcome.*

### ✅ Good JTBD Statements

**Example 1: Study Spots**
> "When I arrive on campus between classes with 45 minutes of free time,  
> I want to quickly find a quiet place with power outlets and stable WiFi,  
> So I can make meaningful progress on my assignments without wasting time searching or getting distracted."

*Why it works:*
- Specific context (between classes, 45 min window)
- Clear functional need (quiet, power, WiFi)
- Deeper outcome (meaningful progress, no wasted time)

**Example 2: Meal Planning**
> "When I'm exhausted after a long day and need to feed my family,  
> I want to quickly decide on a meal that everyone will eat without complaints,  
> So I can feel like a capable parent without spending mental energy on debates or having food go to waste."

*Why it works:*
- Emotional context (exhausted, pressure)
- Specific constraint (everyone will eat it)
- Emotional outcome (feel capable, reduce stress)

**Example 3: Commuter Transport**
> "When I finish my last class and need to get home by 6 PM for work,  
> I want to know the fastest route considering current traffic and transit delays,  
> So I can arrive on time without the anxiety of possibly being late and losing my job."

*Why it works:*
- High stakes context (deadline, consequences)
- Practical need (fastest route with real-time data)
- Emotional relief (reduce anxiety about job security)

## 🎨 Three Types of Jobs

### 1. Functional Job (What they need to accomplish)
The practical, tangible task.

**Examples:**
- Get from point A to point B
- Find information quickly
- Complete an assignment
- Communicate with team members

### 2. Emotional Job (How they want to feel)
The feelings they want to experience (or avoid).

**Examples:**
- Feel in control
- Avoid embarrassment
- Reduce anxiety
- Feel accomplished
- Be perceived as competent

### 3. Social Job (How they want to be perceived)
Their desired image in others' eyes.

**Examples:**
- Be seen as a responsible parent
- Appear professional
- Maintain status in peer group
- Show they care
- Demonstrate expertise

**Great JTBD statements often include all three:**

> "When I'm hosting friends for dinner (context),  
> I want to prepare an impressive meal without spending all day cooking (functional),  
> So I can feel like a great host (emotional) and my friends see me as someone who has it all together (social)."

## 🔍 Discovering JTBD Through Interviews

### Questions That Reveal Jobs

**1. Explore the Context**
- "Walk me through the last time you [did the activity]. What was happening?"
- "What triggered you to start looking for a solution?"
- "What else was going on in your life at that moment?"

**2. Dig Into Motivation**
- "Why was it important to do that right then?"
- "What would have happened if you didn't do it?"
- "What were you hoping would change?"

**3. Uncover the Outcome**
- "How did you feel after you [completed it]?"
- "What did this allow you to do next?"
- "What does success look like in this situation?"

**4. Find Emotional/Social Layers**
- "How did that make you feel?"
- "Who else was affected by this?"
- "What would [relevant person] think if you didn't do this?"

### Interview Example

**Interviewer:** "Tell me about the last time you needed to find a place to study on campus."

**Student:** "Oh yeah, just yesterday. I had 2 hours between my morning classes and afternoon classes. I wanted to work on my programming assignment."

**Interviewer:** "What did you do?"

**Student:** "I went to the library first, but it was packed. Then I tried the CS building, also full. I ended up walking around for like 20 minutes and finally just sat in the cafeteria, but it was so noisy I couldn't concentrate."

**Interviewer:** "How did that make you feel?"

**Student:** "Frustrated, honestly. And stressed because I was wasting time when I had a deadline. I felt behind before I even started."

**Interviewer:** "What were you hoping would happen?"

**Student:** "I just wanted to find a spot quickly so I could focus and actually make progress. Every minute I'm walking around is a minute I'm not coding, and this assignment is worth 20% of my grade."

**Extracted JTBD:**
> "When I have a 2-hour gap between classes and a pressing deadline,  
> I want to quickly secure a quiet workspace where I can focus deeply,  
> So I can make meaningful progress on high-stakes work without the stress of wasted time or falling behind."

## 🛠️ Writing Your Own JTBD

### Step-by-Step Process

**Step 1: Identify the Situation (Context)**

Ask yourself:
- When does this need arise?
- What's happening in their environment?
- What constraints exist? (time, resources, circumstances)
- What triggered this need?

Write the first part:
> "When I [specific situation with relevant constraints]..."

**Step 2: Define the Motivation (Goal)**

Ask yourself:
- What are they trying to accomplish?
- What's the immediate task or problem?
- What are the key requirements or criteria?

Write the second part:
> "I want to [specific goal with clear criteria]..."

**Step 3: Articulate the Outcome (Benefit)**

Ask yourself:
- Why does this matter to them?
- What does success enable them to do?
- What feelings or status change will result?
- What pain are they avoiding?

Write the third part:
> "So I can [meaningful outcome including emotional/functional benefit]..."

**Step 4: Test & Refine**

Check your JTBD:
- [ ] Is the situation specific enough that I can visualize it?
- [ ] Is the motivation clear and actionable?
- [ ] Does the outcome go beyond the obvious?
- [ ] Does it include functional AND emotional elements?
- [ ] Could I use this to make product decisions?

## 🎯 Using JTBD in Product Development

### How JTBD Guides Your Work

**1. Product Prioritization**
"Does this feature help them get the job done better?"

**2. Marketing Messaging**
Speak to the situation and outcome, not features.

**Bad:** "Our app has real-time occupancy data"  
**Good:** "Stop wasting time searching for study spots when you have deadlines looming"

**3. Competitive Analysis**
Your competition isn't just similar products—it's anything they currently "hire" for the job.

*Example: For study spots, competition includes:*
- Walking around until finding a spot (time)
- Asking friends via text (social network)
- Always going to the same backup spot (routine)
- Studying at home instead (alternative location)

**4. Feature Design**
Build features that eliminate obstacles to getting the job done.

*Example JTBD:* "Quickly find a quiet spot with power"

*Obstacles to address:*
- Don't know which spots are available (need: real-time data)
- Don't know which spots are quiet (need: noise level indicators)
- Don't know which have power (need: amenity filters)
- Takes too long to walk to check (need: location-based suggestions)

## 📊 Validating Your JTBD

### Green Flags (Good JTBD)

✅ **Multiple people describe similar situations**
If 7 out of 10 interviewees mention the same context, you've found a real job.

✅ **People show emotion when describing it**
Frustration, anxiety, relief—emotion indicates importance.

✅ **They have current "solutions" (even bad ones)**
If they're already trying to get the job done, the need is real.

✅ **Stakes are clear**
You understand what happens if the job doesn't get done.

✅ **Timing is specific**
You know exactly when the need arises.

### Red Flags (Weak JTBD)

❌ **People say "I guess" or "maybe sometimes"**
Vague language = weak or non-existent job.

❌ **No one can give specific recent examples**
If they can't remember the last time, it's not urgent.

❌ **They don't have current workarounds**
If they're not trying to solve it now, they won't use your solution.

❌ **The outcome is generic**
"Be happier" or "save time" is too broad to be actionable.

## 🧪 JTBD Workshop Exercise

### For Your Team

**Activity: From Interview to JTBD (20 minutes)**

**Step 1:** Pick one interview with rich detail (5 min)
- Select an interview where the person described a specific scenario
- Find a moment where they showed emotion or urgency

**Step 2:** Extract the components (7 min)
- **Context:** What was happening? Write down the situation.
- **Motivation:** What were they trying to do? Write the immediate goal.
- **Outcome:** Why did it matter? Write the desired result.

**Step 3:** Combine into JTBD statement (3 min)
```
When [context from interview],
I want to [motivation from interview],
So I can [outcome from interview].
```

**Step 4:** Validate with team (5 min)
- Does this match what we heard?
- Is it specific enough?
- Does it capture functional AND emotional needs?
- Can we build a solution around this?

## 💡 Common Mistakes & How to Fix Them

### Mistake 1: Describing Your Solution
❌ "When I want to find a study spot, I want to use an app with real-time data"  
✅ "When I have limited time between classes, I want to immediately know where I can productively study"

**Fix:** Remove any mention of your product. Focus only on their world.

### Mistake 2: Being Too Broad
❌ "When I'm at school, I want to learn, so I can graduate"  
✅ "When I'm preparing for a high-stakes exam with only 3 days left, I want to efficiently review the most important concepts, so I can pass without pulling all-nighters"

**Fix:** Add specific constraints, timing, and stakes.

### Mistake 3: Ignoring Emotion
❌ "When I finish class, I want to get home, so I can be at home"  
✅ "When I finish class and need to get to my evening job by 6 PM, I want the fastest route considering current delays, so I can arrive on time without the anxiety of being fired"

**Fix:** Ask "Why does this matter?" until you hit the emotional core.

### Mistake 4: Functional Job Only
❌ "When I'm hungry, I want to eat food, so I'm not hungry"  
✅ "When I'm exhausted after work and my family is asking 'what's for dinner,' I want to quickly prepare something everyone will eat, so I can feel like a capable parent without spending mental energy on complaints"

**Fix:** Include the social or emotional dimension.

## 🔄 JTBD Evolution

### Your JTBD Will Change

**Draft 1:** Based on assumptions
> "When students need to study, they want quiet places, so they can focus"

**Draft 2:** After 5 interviews
> "When commuter students have 1-2 hour gaps between classes, they want productive study spots near their next class, so they don't waste time traveling or lose their parking spot"

**Draft 3:** After 10 interviews
> "When commuter students arrive early to avoid traffic and have 45-90 minutes before class starts, they want to quickly identify quiet spots with outlets within a 3-minute walk of their classroom, so they can make meaningful progress on urgent assignments without the anxiety of being late or having dead phone batteries"

**Each iteration gets more specific and valuable.**

## 🚀 Remember

> "People don't want a quarter-inch drill.  
> They want a quarter-inch hole.  
> Actually, they want to hang a picture.  
> Really, they want to feel at home."

Dig deeper. The job is rarely what it first appears to be.

**Your JTBD is your North Star. Get it right, and everything else becomes clearer.** 🌟
