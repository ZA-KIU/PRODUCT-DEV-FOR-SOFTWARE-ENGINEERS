# Problem Statement Examples: Good vs Bad

## 🎯 What Makes a Good Problem Statement?

A strong problem statement includes:
1. **WHO** - Specific user segment
2. **WHAT** - The specific problem/pain
3. **WHEN/WHERE** - Context when it occurs
4. **IMPACT** - Quantified consequence (time, money, emotion)
5. **WHY** - Root cause (if known)

**Formula:**
> [Specific user segment] + [waste/lose/struggle with] + [quantified impact] + [specific context] + [because/due to] + [root cause]

## ❌ BAD Examples (and Why)

### Example 1: Too Vague
**Problem:** "Students need better apps."

**Why it's bad:**
- Which students? All students? Too broad.
- What kind of apps? For what purpose?
- No specific problem identified
- No measurable impact
- Can't validate this through interviews

---

### Example 2: Solution-Focused
**Problem:** "Students don't have an app to track their study time."

**Why it's bad:**
- Assumes the solution (an app)
- Doesn't explain the actual underlying problem
- Why do they need to track study time? What's the pain?
- Solution-first thinking kills creativity

---

### Example 3: Too Generic
**Problem:** "Education could be improved."

**Why it's bad:**
- Not a specific problem
- No user segment defined
- No measurable impact
- Impossibly broad scope
- Where would you even start?

---

### Example 4: No Impact Quantification
**Problem:** "Students struggle with time management."

**Why it's bad:**
- Vague "struggle" - what does that mean specifically?
- No time/money/emotional cost quantified
- Can't assess severity
- Too common - which specific aspect of time management?

---

### Example 5: Unfalsifiable
**Problem:** "Users want a better experience."

**Why it's bad:**
- Who are the users?
- Better than what?
- What aspect of experience?
- Can't test/validate this
- Pure assumption, no observable behavior

---

### Example 6: Too Niche (Can't Validate)
**Problem:** "Left-handed KIU students born in January who play chess struggle to find study partners."

**Why it's bad:**
- Hyper-specific to the point of being untestable
- Likely can't find 10+ people with this exact problem
- Some constraints are irrelevant (birth month, handedness)
- Seems made up, not observed

---

## ✅ GOOD Examples (and Why)

### Example 1: Study Spots Problem ⭐
**Problem:** "KIU commuter students waste 15+ minutes per day finding quiet study spots between classes during peak hours (10 AM - 2 PM) because real-time occupancy information isn't available."

**Why it's good:**
- **WHO:** KIU commuter students (specific segment)
- **WHAT:** Finding study spots (specific task)
- **IMPACT:** 15+ min/day wasted (quantified)
- **WHEN:** Between classes, peak hours (context)
- **WHY:** No real-time occupancy info (root cause)
- **Testable:** Can interview commuter students
- **Feasible:** Can build occupancy tracker in 8-10 weeks

---

### Example 2: Group Project Coordination
**Problem:** "CS students working on group projects miss 30-40% of milestones because they lack shared visibility into who's doing what and when, leading to duplicated work and last-minute scrambles."

**Why it's good:**
- **WHO:** CS students in group projects
- **WHAT:** Missing milestones (specific failure)
- **IMPACT:** 30-40% miss rate, duplicated work (quantified)
- **WHY:** No shared visibility (root cause)
- **Observable:** Can validate through past project retrospectives
- **Solvable:** Task visibility tool is feasible

---

### Example 3: Commuter Transportation
**Problem:** "KIU students who commute 30+ minutes by public transport waste 2-3 hours per week due to unexpected route changes and delays they discover only after leaving home, causing them to miss classes and work shifts."

**Why it's good:**
- **WHO:** KIU students, 30+ min commute (specific)
- **WHAT:** Route changes/delays (specific issue)
- **IMPACT:** 2-3 hrs/week wasted, missed obligations (quantified + consequence)
- **WHY:** Learning about changes too late (root cause)
- **Accessible:** Can find many commuter students
- **Buildable:** Real-time transport alert system is feasible

---

### Example 4: Assignment Environment Setup
**Problem:** "First and second-year CS students lose 2-4 hours per programming assignment debugging environment setup issues because course instructions don't account for different OS/configurations, causing late submissions and lost points."

**Why it's good:**
- **WHO:** First/second-year CS students (specific)
- **WHAT:** Environment setup debugging (specific)
- **IMPACT:** 2-4 hrs lost per assignment, late submissions (quantified + stakes)
- **WHY:** Instructions don't cover all OS variants (root cause)
- **Real:** Every CS student has experienced this
- **Solvable:** Better setup guide or automated setup tool

---

### Example 5: Healthy Eating on Campus
**Problem:** "KIU students living in dorms spend 45-60 minutes per day deciding what to eat for dinner, often defaulting to unhealthy fast food because they can't quickly identify healthy options within their budget near campus."

**Why it's good:**
- **WHO:** Dorm students (specific)
- **WHAT:** Meal decision paralysis (specific)
- **IMPACT:** 45-60 min/day wasted, unhealthy defaults (quantified + health cost)
- **WHY:** Can't quickly find healthy + affordable options (root cause)
- **Validatable:** Interview dorm students
- **Feasible:** Meal recommendation tool with filters

---

### Example 6: Campus Event Discovery
**Problem:** "KIU students interested in extracurricular activities miss 60-70% of relevant campus events because event information is scattered across 15+ different Discord servers, Instagram pages, and bulletin boards with no central calendar."

**Why it's good:**
- **WHO:** Students interested in extracurriculars (specific)
- **WHAT:** Missing relevant events (specific)
- **IMPACT:** 60-70% miss rate (quantified)
- **WHY:** Info scattered across 15+ sources (specific root cause)
- **Observable:** Can validate by tracking what students heard about
- **Feasible:** Event aggregator/calendar is buildable

---

## 🔄 Transformation: Bad → Good

### Transformation 1
**❌ Bad:** "Students need help with courses"

**✅ Good:** "Third-year KIU students waste 3-5 hours per semester registration period manually checking 40+ course sections for open spots because the registration system doesn't show real-time availability, causing them to get locked out of required courses."

**What changed:**
- Added specific user (3rd year students)
- Identified specific pain (course registration)
- Quantified impact (3-5 hours, locked out of courses)
- Explained context (registration period)
- Identified root cause (no real-time availability)

---

### Transformation 2
**❌ Bad:** "Parking is frustrating"

**✅ Good:** "KIU commuter students who drive to campus waste 20-30 minutes per day circling parking lots during peak arrival times (8-10 AM) because they can't see which lots have available spots, causing them to be late to class and lose attendance points."

**What changed:**
- Specified user (commuter students who drive)
- Quantified time waste (20-30 min/day)
- Added context (8-10 AM peak times)
- Explained root cause (no parking availability visibility)
- Added consequences (late to class, lost points)

---

### Transformation 3
**❌ Bad:** "People don't exercise enough"

**✅ Good:** "KIU students who want to use the campus gym abandon their workout plans 4-5 times per week because they arrive to find all equipment occupied during peak hours (5-7 PM), leading to wasted trip time and fitness goal abandonment."

**What changed:**
- Specified users (students wanting to use gym)
- Quantified behavior (4-5 times/week abandonment)
- Added context (peak hours 5-7 PM)
- Explained root cause (equipment all occupied)
- Identified consequences (wasted time, abandoned goals)

## 🚀 Your Turn: Refinement Exercise

### Take your current problem statement and ask:

1. **Who exactly** experiences this? (Be more specific)
2. **How much** does it cost them? (Quantify in time/money/emotion)
3. **When** does this happen? (Context, frequency)
4. **Why** does this problem exist? (Root cause)
5. **What happens** as a result? (Consequences)

### Example Refinement:

**Draft 1:** "Students struggle with study spots"

**Ask Questions:**
- Who exactly? → "Commuter students"
- How much? → "15+ minutes wasted per day"
- When? → "Between classes, during peak hours"
- Why? → "Because occupancy info isn't available"
- What happens? → "Waste time, miss study opportunities"

**Refined:** "KIU commuter students waste 15+ minutes per day finding quiet study spots between classes during peak hours because real-time occupancy information isn't available."

THE 4 FILTERS (Explained with examples)
🔥 Hair on Fire Test: "Imagine two problems: (A) 'My sock drawer is messy,' and (B) 'My basement is flooding.' Which one do you solve first? The flooding is the hair-on-fire problem. It's urgent, painful, and you'd pay anything to fix it. We are looking for flooded basements, not messy sock drawers."
👥 Access Test: "Let's say you have a brilliant idea for improving surgical robotics. Great problem. But can you find and talk to 10 surgeons this week? Probably not. We need problems where you have direct, immediate access to the target users. 'CS students who struggle with environment setup' is a perfect example. You are sitting in a room full of them."
🛠️ Feasibility Test: "Can a team of 4-5 students build a meaningful MVP in 10 weeks? A new social media platform to compete with Instagram? No. A Chrome extension that helps you focus by blocking certain sites? Absolutely. We need to stay in the realm of the possible."
⚡ Personal Energy Test: "This is the most underrated filter. You will be working on this problem for hundreds of hours. If you are not personally fascinated by it, you will burn out. If the thought of interviewing 20 people about this topic sounds like a chore, it fails this test."
