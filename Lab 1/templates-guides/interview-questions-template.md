## 🚀 Starting the Interview

### Opening Script (2 minutes)

**1. Welcome & Thank Them**
> "Hi [Name]! Thanks so much for making time to chat with me today. I really appreciate it."

**2. Set Expectations**
> "Just to set context: I'm working on a class project at KIU where we're trying to understand [problem area]. I'm not trying to sell you anything or pitch an idea—I genuinely just want to learn from your experience."

**3. Explain the Format**
> "I'll ask you about what you currently do, not what you might do in the future. This should take about 15-20 minutes. Does that work for you?"

**4. Get Recording Consent (if applicable)**
> "Is it okay if I [take notes / record this]? It's just so I don't miss anything important you say. The recording is only for my team's reference and won't be shared."

**5. Confirm They're Still Good**
> "Any questions before we start? Great, let's dive in."

### First Impression Tips
- **Smile** (even on phone calls—they can hear it)
- **Be genuinely curious** (not interrogative)
- **Speak slower than normal** (nerves make us rush)
- **Let silence exist** (don't fill every gap)

## 💬 During the Interview

### The 80/20 Rule
**They should talk 80% of the time. You should talk 20%.**

If you find yourself explaining a lot, you've lost control of the conversation.

### Active Listening Techniques

**1. The Echo**
Repeat their last few words as a question.
- Them: "I usually end up walking around for 15 minutes"
- You: "Walking around for 15 minutes?"
- Them: [elaborates]

**2. The Pregnant Pause**
After they finish, count to 3 before responding. They'll often add the most valuable insight in that silence.

**3. The Summary Check**
"So if I understand correctly, you [summarize]. Is that right?"

**4. The Emotion Probe**
When they show emotion, lean in:
- "You seemed frustrated when you mentioned that. Tell me more."
- "What made that particularly stressful?"

### Follow-Up Question Toolkit

**When they give a vague answer:**
- "Can you give me a specific example?"
- "Walk me through exactly what happened."
- "When was the last time that occurred?"

**When they mention a pain point:**
- "How often does that happen?"
- "What's the impact when it does?"
- "What have you tried to fix it?"

**When they mention a solution/workaround:**
- "How did you discover that approach?"
- "What do you like about it?"
- "What frustrates you about it?"
- "What would make it better?"

**When they mention other people:**
- "What do they do differently?"
- "How common is this problem for them?"
- "Could you introduce me to [person]?"

### Reading the Room

**Green Flags (Keep Going):**
- They're leaning in / engaged
- They're giving detailed stories
- They're showing emotion (excitement, frustration)
- They're referencing specific dates, times, numbers
- They say "Oh yeah, just last week..."

**Yellow Flags (Adjust):**
- They're giving one-word answers → Ask more open questions
- They keep asking about your solution → Redirect to them
- They're being overly positive → Dig for the negative
- They seem confused → Rephrase your question

**Red Flags (Might Not Be Right ICP):**
- They don't relate to the problem
- They say "it's not really an issue for me"
- They can't recall specific examples
- They're checking phone / clearly distracted

### Note-Taking Strategy

**What to Capture:**
- ✅ Direct quotes (especially emotional ones)
- ✅ Specific numbers (time, money, frequency)
- ✅ Tools/apps they mention
- ✅ Names of people they reference
- ✅ Unexpected insights

**What to Skip:**
- ❌ Transcribing everything
- ❌ Generic statements
- ❌ Your own thoughts (save for after)

**Pro Tip:** Use shorthand
- `Q:` = Question
- `A:` = Their answer  
- `!` = Important insight
- `?` = Follow up on this
- `→` = Led to another point

## 🎬 Ending the Interview

### Closing Sequence (2 minutes)

**1. Final Open Question**
> "Is there anything else about [problem area] that I didn't ask about but you think I should know?"

**2. The Referral Ask**  
> "This has been super helpful. I'm trying to talk to more people who [experience this problem]. Who else do you know who deals with this? Would you feel comfortable introducing me?"

**Get specific:**
- Get their name
- Get their context (how they know them)
- Ask if they'll make the intro via email/message

**3. Reciprocity Offer**
> "If we learn anything interesting from all these conversations, would you want me to share it back with you?"

**4. Gratitude**
> "Thank you so much for your time and honesty. This really helps us understand [problem] better."

## 🔄 Learning From Each Interview

### Synthesis Questions

After every interview, ask yourself:

**About the Problem:**
- Is this a real, urgent pain point? (1-10 scale)
- How often does it occur for this person?
- What's it costing them (time, money, emotional energy)?

**About Current Solutions:**
- What are they doing today?
- What have they tried before?
- Why did previous solutions fail?

**About Your Assumptions:**
- What did this confirm?
- What did this contradict?
- What surprised me?

**About Next Steps:**
- Do I need to adjust my ICP?
- Should I pivot my problem focus?
- What should I ask in the next interview?

### Pattern Recognition (After 5 Interviews)

Look for:
- **Frequency:** What did ALL of them mention?
- **Intensity:** What made ALL of them emotional?
- **Current behavior:** What do they ALL do today?
- **Failed solutions:** What have they ALL tried?

**If you're not seeing patterns after 5 interviews:**
- Your ICP might be too broad
- Your problem might not be universal
- You might be asking the wrong questions

## 🚨 Common Interview Mistakes

### Mistake #1: The Pitch Trap
**What it looks like:**
- "We're building an app that does X. What do you think?"
- Explaining your solution in detail
- Getting excited when they compliment your idea

**How to avoid:**
- Literally don't mention your solution
- Focus 100% on their world
- If they ask what you're building: "Still figuring that out—that's why I'm here learning from you"

### Mistake #2: The Leading Question
**What it looks like:**
- "Don't you hate it when X happens?"
- "Wouldn't it be great if Y existed?"
- "This is a huge problem, right?"

**How to avoid:**
- Remove any assumptions from questions
- Ask open-ended: "What happened?" not "Was it frustrating?"
- Let them label the emotion, not you

### Mistake #3: The Hypothetical Trap
**What it looks like:**
- "Would you use a solution that does X?"
- "If we built Y, would you pay for it?"
- "Do you think Z would help?"

**How to avoid:**
- Only ask about past behavior
- Replace "would you" with "have you"
- Focus on what they've done, not what they might do

### Mistake #4: The Validation Seeking
**What it looks like:**
- Getting excited by compliments
- Ignoring contradictory evidence
- Cherry-picking quotes that support your idea

**How to avoid:**
- Treat compliments as noise
- Get excited by contradictions (they're learning!)
- Actively look for reasons your idea won't work

### Mistake #5: The Analysis Paralysis
**What it looks like:**
- Transcribing every word
- Focusing on notes instead of conversation
- Missing non-verbal cues

**How to avoid:**
- Record if possible (with permission)
- Take bullet points only
- Maintain eye contact and connection

## 💪 Pro-Level Techniques

### 1. The Columbo Method
Act slightly confused; people will over-explain.
> "Sorry, I might be slow here... can you walk me through that one more time?"

### 2. The Assumption Flip
State the opposite of what you believe.
> "Most people I've talked to say this isn't really a problem. How do you feel about it?"

(If it IS a problem, they'll correct you with passion)

### 3. The Comparison
Ask them to compare to something else.
> "How does this compare to [other problem] you mentioned?"

Reveals relative priority.

### 4. The Counterfactual
> "If [problem] magically disappeared tomorrow, what would change in your life?"

Reveals true impact.

### 5. The Devil's Advocate
> "Some people say [current solution] is good enough. Why would someone think that?"

They'll either agree (problem not urgent) or passionately disagree (problem IS urgent).
