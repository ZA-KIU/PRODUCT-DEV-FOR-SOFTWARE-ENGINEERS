## 🎯 In-Lab Activities (60 minutes)

### Part 1: Team Formation & Introductions (15 min)
- **Find your team:** Check team assignments posted in class channel
- **Team naming:** Keep assigned name or create your own (90 seconds to decide)
- **Quick intros:** Each person shares (30 seconds):
  - Name & year
  - One technical strength
  - One non-technical skill you bring

### Part 2: Team Contract Workshop (15 min)
**Why this matters:** Your team contract is your founding agreement—it prevents conflicts and ensures everyone knows expectations.

📝 **Complete:** [`team-contract-template.md`](./templates/team-contract-template.md)

**Key decisions you'll make:**
- Who owns what roles? (Tech Lead, Discovery Lead, Program Lead)
- How will we make decisions when we disagree?
- What's our conflict resolution process?
- How often do we meet and communicate?
- How do we track contributions?

### Part 3: Problem Selection Workshop (20 min)

**Step 1: Silent Brainstorm (5 min)**
- Each person shares their 3 submitted ideas
- Write each distinct problem on a sticky note (physical or digital)
- No discussion yet—just capture everything

**Step 2: Grouping (3 min)**
- Cluster similar problems together
- Name each cluster

**Step 3: Filtering (7 min)**  
Use these criteria to narrow to 2-3 finalists:

| Criterion | Question to Ask |
|-----------|----------------|
| 🔥 Hair on Fire Test | Is this a real pain or mild annoyance? |
| 👥 Access Test | Can we easily find 10+ people who have this problem? |
| 🛠️ Feasibility Test | Could we build an MVP solution in 8-10 weeks? |
| ⚡ Team Energy Test | Does this excite at least 3/4 of the team? |

**Step 4: Pick One (5 min)**
- Vote or discuss until consensus
- Write a 1-sentence problem statement

**Examples:**
- ❌ **Bad:** "Students need better apps"
- ✅ **Good:** "KIU commuter students waste 15+ mins finding quiet study spots during peak hours because library occupancy isn't visible"

### Part 4: ICP Draft & Interview Planning (10 min)
📝 **Complete:** [`icp-template.md`](./templates/icp-template.md)

**Your goal:** By end of lab, know WHO you're interviewing and WHERE you'll find them.

**Final task:** Each team shares their problem statement (10 words or less)

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: What if we can't agree on a problem?**  
A: Use your team contract's decision rule. If still stuck, each person presents a 2-minute case, then vote.

**Q: What if we can't find people to interview?**  
A: Start with your immediate network—friends, classmates, roommates. Your first 3 interviews are practice anyway.

**Q: How specific should our ICP be?**  
A: Specific enough that you could walk into a room and pick them out. "Students" is too broad. "3rd year CS students who commute 45+ minutes and study on campus between classes" is good.

**Q: Can we change our problem later?**  
A: Yes! Discovery often reveals you're solving the wrong problem. That's the point.

## 🚨 Common Pitfalls to Avoid
1. **Vague problem statements** - "Make student life better" tells you nothing
2. **Solution-focused thinking** - Don't start with "We should build an app that..."
3. **Assuming you know the problem** - You don't. Your users will teach you.
4. **Skipping the team contract** - This WILL cause issues later. Do it properly now.
