         lots are full before I arrive"
```

## 🚨 Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

### Pitfall 1: Vague Problem Statement
**Problem:** "Students need better study tools"  
**Fix:** Be specific! Who? What? When? How much impact?  
**Good:** "CS students waste 2+ hours per assignment debugging setup issues"

### Pitfall 2: Hypothetical Interview Questions
**Problem:** "Would you use an app that shows study spot availability?"  
**Fix:** Ask about past behavior  
**Good:** "Tell me about the last time you looked for a study spot. What happened?"

### Pitfall 3: No Clear User Access
**Problem:** ICP says "students" - where do you find them?  
**Fix:** Be specific!  
**Good:** "3rd year CS students - accessible via CS Discord (1200 members), CS301 class group (47 members)"

### Pitfall 4: Rushing the Team Contract
**Problem:** Generic copy-paste text, no specifics  
**Fix:** Actually discuss and decide as a team  
**Good:** "Standups: Tuesdays 4PM, Fridays 2PM on Discord. Decision rule: Simple majority; tie goes to Program Lead."

### Pitfall 5: Not Scheduling Interviews Early
**Problem:** Waiting until last minute, scrambling on Tuesday  
**Fix:** Post outreach Saturday/Sunday, schedule as responses come in  
**Good:** By Monday, you already have 2-3 interviews booked for Week 2

## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Team Success:
1. **Do the team contract properly** - You'll thank yourself in Week 5
2. **Pick a problem you've personally experienced** - Easier to stay motivated
3. **Be specific early** - It's easier to broaden than to narrow later
4. **Schedule interviews ASAP** - Don't wait for Tuesday

### For Individual Success:
1. **Read The Mom Test actively** - Take notes, highlight examples
2. **Practice your questions** - Say them out loud, they'll sound different
3. **Start outreach early** - Post Saturday, not Tuesday afternoon
4. **Respond fast** - When someone says "yes" to interview, lock in a time immediately

### For Sanity:
1. **Don't overthink** - Done is better than perfect
2. **You can pivot** - This week's problem might not be the final one
3. **Ask for help** - Use #lab-help channel
4. **Trust the process** - Even if it feels rushed, there's a reason

## 🎯 What's Next (Week 2 Preview)

**Week 2 = Interview Week**

You'll conduct 5-10 user interviews using your Mom Test questions.

**You'll learn:**
- Is your problem real?
- How painful is it actually?
- What do users currently do?
- Should you pivot or proceed?

**But you can only succeed in Week 2 if you:**
- ✅ Have great interview questions (this week!)
- ✅ Know where to find users (this week!)
- ✅ Have interviews already scheduled (this week!)

**Do the work now. Future you will be grateful.**

## 📊 Time Budget Reality Check

**"I don't have time!"** ← We hear you. Here's the reality:

| Day | Time Needed | Can't Skip |
|-----|-------------|------------|
| Thu | 30 min | Submit problems |
| Fri | 60 min | Lab (in class) |
| Sat/Sun | 90 min | Read & learn |
| Mon | 30 min | Submit questions |
| Tue | 60 min | Team work |
| **Total** | **4.5 hours** | **Over 5 days** |

**That's less than 1 hour per day.**

If you're spending more:
- You might be overthinking (done > perfect)
- You might be doing it wrong (ask for help)
- You might need to reprioritize (this matters)

## 🚀 Final Pep Talk

**This week feels like a lot.**

You're forming a team, picking a problem, learning a new method, and scheduling interviews—all in 5 days.

**But here's the truth:**

Startups move at this pace. Product teams make decisions with incomplete information. This is practice for the real world.

**The teams that succeed:**
- Start early ✅
- Stay specific ✅
- Ask for help when stuck ✅
- Trust the process ✅

**The teams that struggle:**
- Procrastinate ❌
- Stay vague ❌
- Suffer in silence ❌
- Resist the structure ❌

**Which team will you be?**

**You've got this. Now go do the work.** 🎯
