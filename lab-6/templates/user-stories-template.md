## Tips for Writing Good User Stories

### ✅ DO:
- Be specific about user type: "commuter student with 30+ min travel time"
- Focus on outcomes, not solutions: "see availability" not "view a dashboard"
- Use direct quotes from interviews as evidence
- Make acceptance criteria testable (you can say yes/no)
- Keep stories independent when possible
- Size stories so they can be completed in < 1 week

### ❌ DON'T:
- Use vague user types: "user" or "person"
- Prescribe implementation: "I want a button that..." (that's design, not story)
- Create stories without interview evidence
- Make acceptance criteria ambiguous
- Create massive stories that take weeks
- Forget dependencies between stories
