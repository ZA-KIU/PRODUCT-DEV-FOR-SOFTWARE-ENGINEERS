## What Are Epics?

**Epics** are large bodies of work that can be broken down into smaller user stories. Each epic represents a major feature or capability of your product. Typically:
- An epic takes 1-2 sprints (2-4 weeks) to complete
- Contains 4-8 user stories
- Delivers significant value to users
- Directly addresses a validated pain point from your interviews

---

## Instructions

1. Review your validated problem statement from `/01-discovery/synthesis/final-problem-statement.md`
2. Identify 3-5 major solution components that would address the problem
3. For each epic below, fill out all sections
4. Cite specific interview evidence wherever possible

**✅ Quality Check:** Each epic should directly solve a pain point you validated. If you can't cite interview evidence, reconsider the epic.
