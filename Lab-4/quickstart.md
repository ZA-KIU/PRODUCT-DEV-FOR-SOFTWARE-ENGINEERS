# Lab 4 Quick Start Guide

**⏱️ 2-Minute Setup | Get Ready for Synthesis**

---

## 🚀 Quick Setup (Do This First)

### 1. Check Your Readiness (2 minutes)

Answer these questions:

- [ ] Do we have 10+ completed interview logs?
- [ ] Does each log have 3+ verbatim quotes?
- [ ] Are all logs in `/01-discovery/interview-logs/`?

**If ALL YES:** ✅ Skip to Step 2  
**If ANY NO:** ⚠️ Use first 30 min of lab for catch-up

---

### 2. Create Synthesis Folder (1 minute)

```bash
cd [your-team-repo]
mkdir -p 01-discovery/synthesis
cd 01-discovery/synthesis
```

---

### 3. Copy Templates (2 minutes)

Copy these 4 essential templates into your synthesis folder:

1. `synthesis-readiness-checklist.md` (fill out first)
2. `affinity-map-template.md` → rename to `affinity-map.md`
3. `patterns-analysis-template.md` → rename to `patterns-analysis.md`
4. `final-problem-statement-template.md` → rename to `final-problem-statement.md`

## 📝 Lab 4 Flow (2 Hours)

### Phase 1: Setup (0:00-0:30)
**If ready:** Fill out readiness checklist (10 min), then start affinity mapping  
**If not ready:** Use catch-up time to complete interviews/logs

3. Document in `affinity-map.md` (5 min)

### Phase 3: Pattern Analysis (1:00-1:30)
1. Count frequencies (10 min)
2. Assess pain intensity (10 min)
3. Complete Five Whys (10 min)

### Phase 4: Problem Statement (1:30-1:50)
1. Draft each component (10 min)
2. Assemble statement (5 min)
3. Quality check & sign-off (5 min)

### Phase 5: Bridge to Design (1:50-2:00)
1. Review next week plan (5 min)
2. Note homework (5 min)

## 🆘 If You're Stuck

**Problem:** Don't have enough interviews  
**Solution:** Use emergency interview template, conduct 2-3 quick interviews in first 30 min

**Problem:** Can't find patterns  
**Solution:** Extract more sticky notes (aim for 50+), look for quotes that sound similar

**Problem:** Problem statement too vague  
**Solution:** Add specific numbers from interviews, use exact ICP language, cite more interviews

**Problem:** Don't know root cause  
**Solution:** Keep asking "why" until you can't go deeper (aim for 5 levels)
