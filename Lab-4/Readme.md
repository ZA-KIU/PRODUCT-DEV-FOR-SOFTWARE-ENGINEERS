## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Do I need to fill out every single field in each template?**  
A: Yes, for required templates. Empty brackets [] should be replaced with your actual content. If a section truly doesn't apply, write "N/A" and explain why.

**Q: Can I modify these templates?**  
A: Yes, but keep the core structure. You can add sections but don't remove required sections.

**Q: What if we don't have 10 interviews yet?**  
A: Use the first 30 minutes of lab for catch-up. Use `emergency-interview-template.md` if needed. You MUST have 10 interviews to proceed with synthesis.

**Q: How long should each document be?**  
A: 
- Synthesis Readiness: 2-3 pages
- Affinity Map: 3-5 pages
- Pattern Analysis: 5-8 pages
- Problem Statement: 6-10 pages
- Milestone: 4-6 pages

**Q: Do we need instructor approval before moving on?**  
A: Yes, instructor will checkpoint at 0:30, 1:00, 1:30, and 1:50 during lab. Final problem statement needs approval before Week 5.

## üÜò Getting Help

**If you're stuck:**
1. Check the examples in `/Lab-4/examples/` folder
2. Review Lab 4 guide: `/Lab-4/README.md`
3. Ask instructor during lab checkpoints
4. Post in Discord `#lab-help` channel
5. Attend office hours: Tuesdays 2-4 PM

**Common issues:**
- **Can't identify patterns:** Review the affinity mapping section in Lab 4 guide
- **Patterns seem forced:** Let data speak, don't force themes
- **Problem statement too vague:** Add more specifics from interviews, use exact quotes
- **Low confidence:** May need more interviews or deeper Five Whys analysis
