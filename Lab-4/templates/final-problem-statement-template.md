## Problem Statement Components

We'll build our final statement by assembling each component with evidence.

---

### Component 1: Specific Segment (WHO)

**From ICP and interview validation:**

**WHO exactly experiences this problem?**

[Detailed description of your ICP - be very specific. Not "students" but "Second-year CS students taking 3+ concurrent project-based courses with distributed teams of 3-4 members working primarily asynchronously"]

**ICP Validation from Interviews:**
- [X/10] interviews matched our ICP criteria perfectly
- [Y/10] interviews were close matches with minor variations
- [Z/10] interviews revealed we should refine ICP to: [refinement]

**Refinements to ICP Based on Discovery:**
- **Original ICP:** [What you started with in Week 1]
- **Validated ICP:** [What interviews confirmed]
- **Key learnings:** [What changed or became more specific]

**Evidence:**
- Interview #[X]: Matches ICP - [Brief description]
- Interview #[Y]: Matches ICP - [Brief description]
- Interview #[Z]: Matches ICP - [Brief description]

---

### Component 2: Specific Problem (WHAT)

**From Pattern #1 (top-ranked pattern from analysis):**

**WHAT problem do they experience?**

[Specific description using language from interviews - not "have trouble coordinating" but "lose visibility into team members' task status and cannot determine who is working on what at any given time"]

**Pattern Validation:**
- Mentioned in: [X/10] interviews
- Supporting quotes: [Y] total
- Intensity rating: [Z/5]

**Key Evidence Quotes:**
1. Interview #[X]: "[Verbatim quote describing the problem]"
2. Interview #[Y]: "[Verbatim quote describing the problem]"
3. Interview #[Z]: "[Verbatim quote describing the problem]"
4. Interview #[W]: "[Verbatim quote describing the problem]"

**Supporting Patterns:**
- Pattern #2: [Name] - Mentioned in [X/10] interviews
- Pattern #3: [Name] - Mentioned in [X/10] interviews

**How patterns relate:**
[1-2 sentences showing how patterns #2 and #3 connect to or stem from pattern #1]

---

### Component 3: Context (WHEN/WHERE)

**From interview stories and situations:**

**WHEN/WHERE does this problem occur?**

[Specific context - "When working asynchronously across multiple weeks on concurrent projects during evening study sessions" or "Between classes when trying to catch up on team progress before next work session"]

**Contextual Evidence:**
- Interview #[X] described situation: "[Brief description of when/where]"
- Interview #[Y] described situation: "[Brief description of when/where]"
- Interview #[Z] described situation: "[Brief description of when/where]"

**Frequency:**
- Daily: [X/10 interviews]
- Weekly: [Y/10 interviews]
- Monthly: [Z/10 interviews]

**Typical Scenarios Where Problem Occurs:**
1. [Scenario 1 - e.g., "Starting a work session and needing to know current status"]
2. [Scenario 2 - e.g., "Near deadlines when trying to assess what's remaining"]
3. [Scenario 3 - e.g., "After being away from project for 2-3 days"]

---

### Component 4: Root Cause (WHY)

**From Five Whys analysis:**

**WHY does this problem exist at the deepest level?**

[Root cause statement - "Because there's no single source of truth for task ownership and progress that integrates seamlessly with their existing workflow and is as frictionless as WhatsApp"]

**Five Whys Chain:**
```
Surface: [Surface problem]
  ↓ Why?
[Level 1]
  ↓ Why?
[Level 2]
  ↓ Why?
[Level 3]
  ↓ Why?
[Level 4]
  ↓ Why?
ROOT CAUSE: [Final root cause]
```

**Evidence of Root Cause:**
- Interview #[X]: "[Quote revealing root cause]"
- Interview #[Y]: "[Quote revealing root cause]"
- Interview #[Z]: "[Quote revealing root cause]"

**How we validated this is the root cause:**
[Explanation: This root cause explains multiple surface problems, appeared across many interviews, and users explicitly mentioned the underlying need when probed]

**Surface problems this root cause explains:**
1. [Surface problem 1 - e.g., "WhatsApp message overload"]
2. [Surface problem 2 - e.g., "Last-minute integration panic"]
3. [Surface problem 3 - e.g., "Duplicated work"]

---

### Component 5: Measurable Consequences (IMPACT)

**From interview data and quantified impact:**

**WHAT happens as a result? What is the measurable impact?**

**Time Impact:**
- Average time wasted: [X hours per week per person]
- Range: [Min - Max hours]
- Evidence: Interview #[X] ("[Quote with time data]"), Interview #[Y] ("[Quote]")

**Emotional/Stress Impact:**
- Self-reported stress levels: [Average X/10]
- Emotional language used: [frustrated (8/10 interviews), anxious (6/10), hate (4/10)]
- Evidence: Interview #[X] ("[Quote]"), Interview #[Y] ("[Quote]")

**Quality/Output Impact:**
- Last-minute scrambles: [X/10 interviews mentioned]
- Duplicated work: [Y/10 interviews mentioned]
- Integration issues: [Z/10 interviews mentioned]
- Evidence: Interview #[X] ("[Quote]"), Interview #[Y] ("[Quote]")

**Behavioral Impact:**
- [What behaviors changed due to this problem?]
- Evidence: Interview #[X] ("[Quote]")

**Frequency of Impact:**
- Occurs: [Daily/Weekly/Monthly]
- Mentioned by: [X/10 interviews]

**Summary of Consequences:**
[2-3 sentence summary of overall impact with specific numbers]

Example: "Results in 2-4 hours per week spent on coordination overhead (8/10 interviews), last-minute integration scrambles within 24 hours of deadlines (9/10 interviews), duplicated work effort (5/10 interviews), and elevated stress levels averaging 7.5/10 self-reported during project crunch periods (10/10 interviews)."

## FINAL PROBLEM STATEMENT

### Complete Statement

**[Assemble all five components into one comprehensive problem statement]**

[Specific segment WHO] experiences [specific problem WHAT] in [context WHEN/WHERE] because [root cause WHY], resulting in [measurable consequences IMPACT].

**Evidence documented across [X] customer discovery interviews** conducted in Weeks 3-4 ([Date range]), with strong validation from interviews #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #6, #7, #8, #9, #10. Top pain points identified: [List your top 3 pattern names]. Root cause analysis completed using Five Whys methodology.

---

### Example Format (Replace with YOUR statement):

"Second-year CS students taking 3+ concurrent project-based courses with distributed teams (3-4 members) working primarily asynchronously struggle to maintain real-time visibility into teammates' task status and cannot easily determine who is working on what at any given moment because there's no single source of truth for task ownership and progress that integrates seamlessly into their existing workflow and is as frictionless as WhatsApp, resulting in 2-4 hours per week spent on coordination overhead through message-checking and status-requesting (evidence: 8/10 interviews, avg 3.2 hrs/week), last-minute integration crises within 24 hours of project deadlines when discovering status misalignments (evidence: 9/10 interviews), duplicated work effort (evidence: 5/10 interviews), and elevated stress levels averaging 7.5/10 self-reported during project crunch periods (evidence: 10/10 interviews).

Evidence documented across 10 customer discovery interviews conducted October 20-November 1, 2025, with strong validation from interviews #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #6, #7, #8, #9, #10. Top pain points identified: (1) Invisible task status across async work, (2) WhatsApp message overload burying updates, (3) Last-minute coordination panic before deadlines. Root cause analysis completed using Five Whys methodology, identifying lack of persistent single source of truth as underlying issue."

## Next Phase: Design Direction

### Implications for Solution Design

**Based on this validated problem, our solution MUST:**

1. **[Design Requirement 1]**
   - Why: [Directly addresses root cause/pattern]
   - Evidence: [Interview citations]

2. **[Design Requirement 2]**
   - Why: [Addresses key constraint/context]
   - Evidence: [Interview citations]

3. **[Design Requirement 3]**
   - Why: [Addresses measurable impact]
   - Evidence: [Interview citations]

**Based on this validated problem, our solution SHOULD:**
- [Nice-to-have characteristic 1]
- [Nice-to-have characteristic 2]

**Based on this validated problem, our solution MUST NOT:**
