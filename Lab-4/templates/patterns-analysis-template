## Pain Intensity Analysis

For each major pattern, we assess how painful this problem is based on emotional language, impact described, and interviewee reactions.

**Intensity Scale:**
- ⚠️ (1/5): Mild annoyance, "it's a bit inconvenient"
- ⚠️⚠️ (2/5): Noticeable frustration, "it's annoying"
- ⚠️⚠️⚠️ (3/5): Significant pain, "I really dislike this"
- ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️ (4/5): Major pain, "I hate this" or "it causes stress"
- ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️ (5/5): Severe pain, "hair on fire", emotional language, quantified impact

## Root Cause Analysis

For top 3-5 patterns, we use the Five Whys methodology to identify root causes vs. symptoms.

---

### Pattern 1: [Surface Problem Description]

**Five Whys Exercise:**

**Surface Problem:** [What users described experiencing]

1. **Why does this happen?**  
   → [Answer from interviews]

2. **Why does THAT happen?**  
   → [Dig deeper]

3. **Why does THAT happen?**  
   → [Keep going]

4. **Why does THAT happen?**  
   → [Almost there]

5. **Why does THAT happen?**  
   → [Root cause revealed]

**ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:**
[Clear statement of the underlying root cause]

**Is this a root cause or symptom?**
☐ Root cause (explains multiple surface problems)  
☐ Symptom (could ask "why" again)

**Evidence from Interviews:**
- Interview #[X]: "[Quote revealing root cause]"
- Interview #[Y]: "[Quote revealing root cause]"
- Interview #[Z]: "[Quote revealing root cause]"

**How many surface problems does this root cause explain?**
1. [Surface problem 1]
2. [Surface problem 2]
3. [Surface problem 3]

## Final Pattern Ranking

Ranking all patterns by combining frequency, intensity, and root cause depth:

| Rank | Pattern Name | Frequency Score (X/10) | Intensity Score (1-5) | Root Cause Depth | TOTAL STRENGTH |
|------|--------------|------------------------|-----------------------|------------------|----------------|
| 1 | [Pattern] | 9/10 (90%) | 5/5 | Deep | **A+** |
| 2 | [Pattern] | 8/10 (80%) | 4/5 | Deep | **A** |
| 3 | [Pattern] | 7/10 (70%) | 4/5 | Medium | **B+** |
| 4 | [Pattern] | 6/10 (60%) | 3/5 | Medium | **B** |
| 5 | [Pattern] | 5/10 (50%) | 2/5 | Surface | **C** |

---

### Scoring Criteria

**Frequency Score:** 
- Simply: # of interviews that mentioned it / 10

**Intensity Score:** 
- From pain intensity analysis (1-5 scale)

**Root Cause Depth:**
- **Deep:** Identified through 5 Whys, explains multiple surface problems, has clear interview evidence
- **Medium:** Went 2-3 levels deep, explains some surface problems
- **Surface:** This IS the symptom, didn't dig deeper

**Total Strength (Letter Grade):**
- **A+/A:** Top patterns - highest frequency, highest intensity, deep root cause
- **B+/B:** Strong patterns - good evidence but less frequent or less painful
- **C:** Weak patterns - lower validation, might be edge cases

## Product Direction Implications

**Our solution must address:**
1. **PRIMARY:** The root cause of Pattern #1 - [brief description]
2. **SUPPORT:** Also consider Pattern #2 and #3 in design

**What this means for solution design:**
- [Implication 1 - what characteristics the solution needs]
- [Implication 2 - what constraints we need to work within]
- [Implication 3 - what user behaviors we need to enable]

**What we should NOT focus on:**
- [Pattern/area that scored low - why we're deprioritizing]
- [Edge cases that only 1-2 people mentioned]

---

## Decision & Rationale

**DECISION:** We will focus our product solution on addressing **[Primary Pattern Name]**, with supporting consideration for **[Secondary Pattern Name]** and **[Tertiary Pattern Name]**.

**RATIONALE:**
[3-5 sentences explaining:
- Why this ranking makes sense given your data
- Why Pattern #1 is the most important to solve
- How patterns #2 and #3 support or relate to #1
- What you'll build around (general direction, not specific solution yet)]

**Example rationale:**
"Pattern #1 appeared in 9/10 interviews with severe pain intensity (5/5) and has a clear root cause: lack of a single source of truth for task status. Patterns #2 (message overload) and #3 (last-minute panic) are both symptoms of this root cause. By addressing the root cause through a persistent, frictionless status tracking solution, we expect to alleviate all three patterns. This represents the highest-leverage problem to solve given our 10-week timeline and technical capabilities."
