## Overview

This document captures the affinity mapping exercise where we transformed raw interview data into clustered themes and patterns.

- Created [Y] sticky notes with individual insights
- Grouped similar insights into clusters through silent sorting
- Identified [Z] distinct themes

**Time Invested:** [X minutes]

**Photo Documentation:** See `affinity-map-photo.jpg` in this folder

## Outliers & Unique Insights

**Insights That Didn't Fit Into Clusters:**

These are insights that appeared in only 1-2 interviews or didn't relate to other themes:

1. **[Outlier Insight 1]**
   - From Interview #[X]
   - Why it's unique: [Explanation]

2. **[Outlier Insight 2]**
   - From Interview #[X]
   - Why it's unique: [Explanation]

3. **[Outlier Insight 3]**
   - From Interview #[X]
   - Why it's unique: [Explanation]

**Decision:** ☐ Worth exploring further ☐ Set aside as edge case

## Cluster Relationships

**Connections Between Clusters:**

Are any of your clusters related to each other? Note relationships here.

**Example:**
- Cluster 1 ([Theme]) and Cluster 3 ([Theme]) both stem from [root cause]
- Cluster 2 ([Theme]) is a consequence of Cluster 4 ([Theme])

**Relationship Map:**
```
[Cluster 1] ←→ [Cluster 3]
     ↓
[Cluster 2] ←→ [Cluster 4]
     ↓
[Cluster 5]
```

## Initial Observations & Surprises

**What Surprised Us:**
1. [Surprise #1 - Something unexpected that came up in clustering]
2. [Surprise #2 - Pattern we didn't anticipate]
3. [Surprise #3 - Something almost everyone mentioned]

**What Validated Our Hypothesis:**
1. [Expected pattern #1 that was confirmed]
2. [Expected pattern #2 that was confirmed]

**What Contradicted Our Hypothesis:**
1. [Something we assumed but data disproved]
2. [Area where we were wrong]

## Strongest Patterns (Preliminary)

Based on frequency and clustering density, the strongest patterns appear to be:

1. **[Cluster Name]** - [X/10 interviews, Y quotes]
2. **[Cluster Name]** - [X/10 interviews, Y quotes]
3. **[Cluster Name]** - [X/10 interviews, Y quotes]

**Note:** These will be further analyzed in the Pattern Analysis document with intensity and root cause assessment.
