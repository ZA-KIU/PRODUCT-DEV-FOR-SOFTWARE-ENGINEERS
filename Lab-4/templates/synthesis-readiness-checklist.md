## Team Readiness Assessment

**Overall Status:** 
- ✅ **READY FOR SYNTHESIS** - We have 10+ quality interviews and can proceed to affinity mapping
- ⚠️ **NEED CATCH-UP** - We need to complete [describe what's missing] before synthesis

**If Not Ready, Action Items:**
1. [Action item 1 - who owns it, by when]
2. [Action item 2 - who owns it, by when]
3. [Action item 3 - who owns it, by when]

**Target Completion Time:** [If catch-up needed, estimate when you'll be ready]
