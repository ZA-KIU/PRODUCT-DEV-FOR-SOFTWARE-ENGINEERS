## Hypothesis Being Tested

[Copy your hypothesis from hypothesis.md]

> "We believe [doing X] for [target user] will result in [measurable outcome] because [assumption]."

---

## Experiment Portfolio

We will run [2-3] experiments in sequence to validate our hypothesis:

**Progression:**
1. **Smoke Test** → Validate interest/demand
2. **Wizard of Oz** → Validate solution approach
3. **MVP** → Validate product-market fit

---

## Experiment #1: [Name of Experiment]

### Overview
**Type:** Smoke Test / Landing Page / Fake Door / Concierge / Wizard of Oz / MVP

**Goal:**
[What assumption are you testing?]

**Timeline:**
- **Build:** [X days to create]
- **Run:** [X days live]
- **Analyze:** [X hours to review data]
- **Total:** [X days]

---

### What We'll Build

**Deliverable:**
[Specific thing you'll create]
- Example: "Landing page with email signup"
- Example: "Fake button on existing site"
- Example: "Manual SMS service for 10 beta users"

**Tools:**
- [Tool 1: e.g., Carrd for landing page]
- [Tool 2: e.g., Google Forms for signups]
- [Tool 3: e.g., Google Analytics for tracking]

**Budget:** $0 (must use free tools)

**Effort:** [X hours to build]

- **Next step:** [What we'll do]

**Failure:**
- **If we achieve:** [Specific number]
- **Then we conclude:** [What this means]
- **Next step:** [Pivot strategy]

**Inconclusive:**
- **If we achieve:** [Range]
- **Then we:** [How to get more clarity]

---

### Distribution Strategy

**How will we get people to see this experiment?**

**Week 1:**
- Day 1-2: [Activity, e.g., "Post in class Discord"]
- Day 3-4: [Activity, e.g., "Share on personal social media"]
- Day 5-7: [Activity, e.g., "Ask friends to share"]

**Estimated Reach:**
- [Realistic estimate of how many people might see it]

---

### Risks & Mitigation

**Risk #1:** [Something that could go wrong]
- **Likelihood:** High / Medium / Low
- **Impact:** High / Medium / Low
- **Mitigation:** [How you'll handle it]

**Risk #2:** [Another risk]
- **Likelihood:** High / Medium / Low
- **Impact:** High / Medium / Low
- **Mitigation:** [How you'll handle it]

## Experiment #2: [Name of Experiment]

[Repeat structure from Experiment #1]

**Note:** Only start this if Experiment #1 succeeds or provides actionable insights

---

## Experiment #3: [Name of Experiment]

[Repeat structure from Experiment #1]

**Note:** Only start this if Experiment #2 succeeds

## Decision Tree

Based on experiment results, here's our decision logic:
Experiment #1 Result
├─ If ✅ Success (>= success threshold)
│  └─ Proceed to Experiment #2
├─ If ❌ Failure (<= failure threshold)
│  └─ Go back to customer discovery
│      └─ Re-validate problem
│      └─ Revisit solution approach
└─ If ⚠️ Inconclusive (in gray zone)
└─ Option A: Extend Experiment #1
└─ Option B: Modify hypothesis and retest
