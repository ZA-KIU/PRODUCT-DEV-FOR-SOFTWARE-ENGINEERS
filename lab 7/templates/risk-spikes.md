## What are Risk Spikes?

Risk spikes are small, time-boxed experiments designed to reduce technical uncertainty BEFORE committing significant development time.

**Purpose:** Test risky technical assumptions quickly and cheaply.

---

## Identified Technical Risks

### Risk #1: [Name of uncertainty]

**Description:**
[What don't you know? What could go wrong?]

**Impact if this fails:** High / Medium / Low
- [Explain what happens if this doesn't work]

**Likelihood of failure:** High / Medium / Low
- [How confident are you this will work?]

**Overall Risk Level:** HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW
- Risk = Impact × Likelihood

---

**Spike Hypothesis:**
"If we can [achieve X], then we can proceed with [building Y]"

**Experiment Design:**

**Time-box:** [2-4 hours max]

**What we'll build:**
- [Minimal proof-of-concept]
- [Specific thing to test]
- [No production-quality code needed]

**Success Criteria:**
- [Specific, measurable outcome that proves this works]
- Example: "Successfully fetch and display real-time library data"

**Failure Criteria:**
- [What would mean this approach won't work]

**Tools/Resources needed:**
- [What do you need to run this spike?]

**Owner:** [Who will run this spike?]

**Deadline:** [By when?]

---

**Outcomes & Next Steps:**

**If spike SUCCEEDS:**
- [ ] Document what worked
- [ ] Update architecture with confirmed approach
- [ ] Proceed with full implementation

**If spike FAILS:**
- [ ] Document what didn't work
- [ ] Identify why it failed
- [ ] Plan alternative approach (see backup plan below)

**Backup Plan:**
[What's your alternative if this doesn't work?]

---

### Risk #2: [Name of uncertainty]

[Repeat same structure as Risk #1]

---

### Risk #3: [Name of uncertainty]

[Repeat same structure as Risk #1]
