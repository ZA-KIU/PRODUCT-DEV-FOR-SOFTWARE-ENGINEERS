# Product Hypothesis

**Team:** [Your Team Name]  
**Product:** [Your Product Name]  
**Date:** [Date Created]  
**Version:** 1.0

## Our Hypothesis

**Full Statement:**
> "We believe [doing X] for [target user] will result in [measurable outcome] because [assumption about user behavior]."

**Example (StudySpot):**
> "We believe showing real-time library occupancy percentages for KIU Computer Science students will result in 50+ email signups in Week 1 because students currently waste 15 minutes per day finding quiet study spots and desire real-time information."

## Components Breakdown

### What (The Action/Feature):
[What specifically will you build or show?]

### Who (Target User):
[Who is your Ideal Customer Profile?]
- [Be specific: not "students" but "KIU CS students in years 2-3"]

### Result (Measurable Outcome):
[What specific, measurable outcome are you predicting?]
- **Metric:** [Example: Email signups]
- **Number:** [Example: 50+]
- **Timeframe:** [Example: Within 7 days]

### Why (Assumption):
[What assumption about user behavior makes you believe this will work?]
- [What pain point does this solve?]
- [Why would users care?]

## Success & Failure Criteria

### Success Threshold:
**If we achieve:** [Specific number/outcome]
**Then we conclude:** [What this means]
**Next step:** [What we'll build next]

**Example:**
- **If we achieve:** 50+ signups in 7 days
- **Then we conclude:** There's strong demand for this feature
- **Next step:** Build MVP with real-time data

---

### Failure Threshold:
**If we achieve:** [Specific number/outcome]
**Then we conclude:** [What this means]
**Next step:** [Pivot strategy]

**Example:**
- **If we achieve:** <10 signups in 7 days
- **Then we conclude:** Problem isn't painful enough or solution isn't compelling
- **Next step:** Go back to customer interviews, validate problem again

---

### Gray Zone (Inconclusive):
**If we achieve:** [Range that's unclear]
**Then we:** [How we'll get more data]

**Example:**
- **If we achieve:** 10-49 signups
- **Then we:** Extend experiment 1 more week OR interview signups to understand hesitation

## Underlying Assumptions

List all assumptions embedded in your hypothesis:

1. **Assumption:** [Example: Students actually waste time finding study spots]
   - **Validated?** ✅ Yes / ❌ No / ⚠️ Partially
   - **Evidence:** [From interviews, observations, data]

2. **Assumption:** [Example: Real-time data is more valuable than static maps]
   - **Validated?** ✅ Yes / ❌ No / ⚠️ Partially
   - **Evidence:** [From interviews, etc.]

3. **Assumption:** [Example: Students would use a digital tool for this vs asking friends]
   - **Validated?** ✅ Yes / ❌ No / ⚠️ Partially
   - **Evidence:** [From interviews, etc.]

## Validation Plan

**How we will test this hypothesis:**

### Experiment #1: [Name]
- **Type:** Smoke test / Landing page / Fake door / etc.
- **What we'll build:** [Specific deliverable]
- **Metric:** [What we'll measure]
- **Timeline:** [When]

### Experiment #2: [Name]
- [If Experiment #1 succeeds, what's next?]

### Experiment #3: [Name]
- [If Experiment #2 succeeds, what's next?]

## Risks to Hypothesis

**What could invalidate this?**

1. **Risk:** [Example: Students sign up but never use the product]
   - **Mitigation:** [Track not just signups but activation rate]

2. **Risk:** [Example: Library doesn't allow data scraping]
   - **Mitigation:** [Have backup plan to use manual entry]

3. **Risk:** [Example: Students want more than just occupancy data]
   - **Mitigation:** [Interviews to understand what else they need]
