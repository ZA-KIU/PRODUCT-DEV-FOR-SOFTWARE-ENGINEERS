## Why the Demo Video Matters

Demo Day judges see 10+ pitches in a row. Your demo video:
- **Proves your product actually works** (not just mockups or ideas)
- **Shows the problem being solved** (not just features)
- **Keeps attention** (visual beats talking)
- **Provides backup** (if live demo fails)
- **Demonstrates execution** (you built something real)

**Bad demo = "This is cool, but does it work?"**  
**Good demo = "Wow, I need this!"**

**Key Principle:** Show, don't tell. 60 seconds of product in action beats 10 minutes of explanation.

## What to Show

### ✅ DO Show:

**1. The Pain First (3-5 seconds)**
- Start with the problem state
- Example: "Finding a study room usually takes 15 minutes. Watch this."
- Sets context for why your product matters

**2. One Complete User Journey**
- Beginning to end
- Actual problem being solved
- Real data (not "lorem ipsum" or fake content)
- Happy path (no errors)

**3. The Magic Moment**
- When your product does something smart/automated
- The "wow" feature that differentiates you
- What makes you better than alternatives

**4. The Result**
- Problem solved
- Time saved (quantify it!)
- User benefit achieved
- Before/after comparison

**5. Real Use Case**
- Scenario customers actually face
- From your interview data (Lab 2-4)
- Authentic, not contrived

### ❌ DON'T Show:

**1. Multiple disconnected features**
- ❌ "Here's the dashboard, here's settings, here's reports..."
- ✅ Pick ONE complete flow that solves THE problem

**2. Bugs or incomplete features**
- Only show what actually works
- Polish the happy path
- Better to show less that works than more that's broken

**3. Lengthy setup or login**
- Start already logged in
- Skip account creation screens
- Jump straight to value

**4. Your face explaining (unless intentional)**
- Product should be the star
- Voiceover is fine
- But don't block the screen with your face

**5. Reading text from the screen**
- Viewers can read
- Narrate the ACTION, not the labels
- "Click 'Find Room'" not "Here's a button that says 'Find Room'"

"Maria updates progress to 50%. Everyone on the team sees it instantly. 
No Slack messages. No interrupting her."

[45-55s] BLOCKER HANDLING

with screenshots, updates timeline, and schedules next task."

[70-80s] RESULT
"5-hour project coordinated in 5 minutes. No meetings. No Slack chaos."

[80-85s] CTA
"Get TaskFlow at taskflow.io. Your team's new operating system."
```

**Why this works:**
- Multiple "wow" moments (auto-subtasks, auto-reports)
- Shows team collaboration without showing team
- Clear time savings
- Addresses common pain points

### Example 3: MealPal (Restaurant Discovery)

**Type:** Mobile app  
**Hook:** Decision paralysis  
**Core flow:** Preferences → Recommendations → Order  
**Duration:** 65 seconds

```
[0-5s] HOOK
"Deciding where to eat with friends takes 20 minutes of back-and-forth texts. 
This is faster."

[5-15s] SETUP GROUP
[Screen: Create group, add 3 friends]

[60-65s] CTA
"Download MealPal. Make group decisions faster."
```

**Why this works:**
- Relatable problem (group decisions)
- Shows multiple user perspectives
- Clear time savings
- Social proof built in

## Recording Best Practices

### Before Recording

**1. Prepare Your Environment (5 minutes)**
- [ ] Close all unnecessary tabs/apps
- [ ] Turn off notifications
  - Mac: Control Center → Do Not Disturb
  - Windows: Action Center → Focus Assist
  - Phone: Do Not Disturb mode
- [ ] Clear browser history/autocomplete (no embarrassing suggestions)
- [ ] Hide sensitive info (emails, names, phone numbers)
- [ ] Use realistic test data (not "asdf" or "test user")

**2. Set Up Your Screen (3 minutes)**
- [ ] Window size: Not too small (text unreadable) or too large (wasted space)
- [ ] Zoom browser if needed: Command/Ctrl + (make text bigger)
- [ ] Resolution: 1080p minimum (1920x1080)
- [ ] Lighting: Good if showing phone or physical product
- [ ] Sound check: If doing voiceover, test microphone

**3. Practice Dry Run (10 minutes)**
- [ ] Click through flow 3-5 times
- [ ] Get smooth at cursor movements
- [ ] Memorize where to click (no hesitation)
- [ ] Time yourself (should be under 80 seconds)
- [ ] Note any steps that take too long

**Pro Tip:** Do dry run with teammate watching. They'll catch things you miss.

### During Recording

**Voice (if narrating):**
- Speak clearly and slightly slower than normal
  - You'll speed up when nervous
  - Give viewers time to process
- Pause briefly between sentences
  - Easier to edit later
  - Gives viewer breathing room
- Don't say "um," "uh," "so," "like"
  - Practice script beforehand
  - It's okay to pause silently
- Energy and enthusiasm!
  - You're excited about this product
  - Enthusiasm is contagious

**Mouse/Cursor Movements:**
- Smooth movements (not jerky or frantic)
- Move deliberately to what you're clicking
- Pause cursor on element for 1 second before clicking
- After clicking, pause to show result
- Don't circle or wiggle cursor randomly

**Pacing:**
- Not too slow (viewers get bored)
- Not too fast (confusing, hard to follow)
- Let each action complete before moving to next
- Show results of each action (confirmation messages, updates)
- Match your narration speed to screen speed

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- ❌ Clicking before narrating what you're doing
  - ✅ Say it THEN do it
- ❌ Moving too fast through screens
  - ✅ Pause 2 seconds on each new screen
- ❌ Not showing the outcome
  - ✅ After action, show what changed
- ❌ Apologizing or saying "oops"
  - ✅ Just stop recording and start over

### After Recording

**1. Review Your Video (3 minutes)**
- [ ] Watch full video start to finish
- [ ] Check: Is text readable?
- [ ] Check: Is audio clear (if voiceover)?
- [ ] Check: Does it make sense without explanation?
- [ ] Check: Any awkward pauses or mistakes?
- [ ] Check: Under 90 seconds?

**2. Decide: Keep or Redo?**

**Keep it if:**
- Main flow is clear
- No major bugs visible
- Under 90 seconds
- Text readable
- Makes sense

**Redo if:**
- Major confusion in flow
- Bug or error visible
- Over 2 minutes (can't edit down)
- Text unreadable
- Audio has loud background noise

**Remember:** Perfect is the enemy of done. If it's 80% good, keep it and move on.

## Editing Your Video

### Simple Editing (Most People)

**Tool Options:**
1. **iMovie (Mac)** - Free, simple
2. **Windows Video Editor** - Free, built-in to Windows 10/11
3. **Kapwing (Web)** - kapwing.com, free tier
4. **Loom** - Built-in trimming

**Basic Edits You Might Need:**

**1. Trim Start/End**
- Cut first 3 seconds (before you start)
- Cut last 5 seconds (after CTA)
- Most tools: drag handles on timeline

**2. Cut Out Mistakes**
- Pause or loading screen too long
- Clicked wrong thing
- Most tools: split clip, delete section

**3. Speed Up Slow Parts**
- Loading screens
- Long forms being filled out
- Most tools: select section, speed 1.5x or 2x

**4. Add Text Overlays (Optional)**
- Key stats: "Saves 15 minutes"
- Feature labels: "Auto-generate reports"
- Most tools: text tool, place on screen

**5. Fade In/Out (Optional)**
- Smooth start/end
- Most tools: transitions section

### Do NOT Over-Edit

**You DON'T need:**
- Fancy transitions
- Background music (often distracting)
- Multiple camera angles
- Special effects
- Custom animations

**Simple is better.** Your product is the star.

### Export Settings

**Format:** MP4 (most compatible)  
**Resolution:** 1080p (1920x1080) preferred, 720p acceptable  
**Frame Rate:** 30fps is fine  
**Codec:** H.264  
**File Size:** Under 50MB (compress if larger)

Most tools have a "YouTube" preset that works great.

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: "My demo takes 3 minutes, not 90 seconds"

**Solution A: Cut steps**
- Show ONLY the core value flow
- Skip login/setup (start already in)
- Remove secondary features
- Focus on problem → solution

**Solution B: Speed up video**
- Edit in video editor
- Speed up 1.25x or 1.5x
- Or speed up just the slow parts (forms, loading)

**Solution C: Two shorter videos**
- Make 45-second "Core Flow" video
- Make 45-second "Advanced Features" video
- Use core flow in pitch

### Problem: "My app has loading spinners / API calls"

**Solution A: Speed up during edit**
- Speed those sections 2x-4x
- Or cut them out entirely
- Jump from action to result

**Solution B: Pre-load data**
- Before recording, trigger API calls
- Then record with cached data
- Everything loads instantly

**Solution C: Use faster test environment**
- Local development (faster than production)
- Test database with less data
- Mock API responses

**Solution D: Add text overlay**
- During loading: text says "Loading..."
- Or: "Analyzing 10,000 records..."
- Makes it clear it's supposed to load

### Problem: "I'm not good at voiceover / I hate my voice"

**Solution A: Silent demo with text**
- No narration
- Use text overlays to explain each step
- Add text at top/bottom of screen

**Solution B: Multiple takes**
- Record narration 3-5 times
- Pick the best one
- Edit together best parts

**Solution C: Teammate does voiceover**
- Someone else on team narrates
- You click through the demo
- Record audio separately, sync later

**Solution D: Captions only**
- Record demo without sound
- Add captions in video editor
- YouTube-style format

### Problem: "My screen recording is laggy / low frame rate"

**Solution A: Close other apps**
- Quit everything except your MVP
- Restart computer first
- Don't record while running heavy apps

**Solution B: Record smaller window**
- Don't record full 4K screen
- Record just your app window
- Smaller area = better performance

**Solution C: Use different tool**
- Try Loom instead of built-in
- Or OBS Studio (free, powerful)
- Update graphics drivers

**Solution D: Record on better computer**
- Teammate's laptop
- School computer lab
- Friend's desktop

### Problem: "I don't have a working MVP yet"

**Solution A: Clickable prototype**
- Export from Figma as prototype
- Click through it
- Record as if it's real app
- Narrate what it WILL do

**Solution B: Screenshot video**
- Take 10-15 screenshots of key screens
- Import into PowerPoint/Keynote
- Add transitions (0.5s each)
- Animate between screens
- Export as video
- Add narration explaining flow

**Solution C: Partial demo**
- Show the parts that DO work
- For incomplete parts: "Coming soon: [feature]"
- Be honest: "Building now, launching [date]"

**Solution D: Competitor demo + explanation**
- Find similar product demo
- Show it briefly
- Explain: "Ours will do this, PLUS [your differentiation]"
- Only if you really have nothing

### Problem: "Demo has a bug / error that we can't fix in time"

**Solution A: Work around it**
- Demo different feature
- Use test account that doesn't trigger bug
- Start from middle of flow (skip buggy part)

**Solution B: Acknowledge it**
- Show demo
- If bug appears, text overlay: "Beta - fixing this week"
- Shows transparency
- Better than hiding it

**Solution C: Use older version**
- Revert to last working version
- Record demo with that
- Continue fixing current version

### Problem: "App looks ugly / unpolished"

**Solution A: Focus on functionality**
- Show that it WORKS
- Narration: "MVP focused on core functionality"
- Design polish is Week 13

**Solution B: Record just the polished screens**
- Skip screens with bad UI
- Show only the good parts
- Narration covers the gaps

**Solution C: One hour of polish**
- Fix just the colors/fonts on main screens
- Make buttons consistent
- Clean up alignment
- Don't redesign, just tidy

## Final Tips

### Do:
✅ Keep it simple - product is the star  
✅ Show real product (even if rough)  
✅ Focus on one complete user journey  
✅ Practice 5+ times before recording  
✅ Start with the problem/pain  
✅ End with clear call to action  
✅ Use real data (not placeholder text)  
✅ Make text readable  
✅ Record backup (USB, multiple formats)

### Don't:
❌ Over-produce (fancy effects distract)  
❌ Show features that don't work  
❌ Make it longer than 90 seconds  
❌ Read text that's on screen  
❌ Apologize or show uncertainty  
❌ Include your face blocking screen (unless intentional)  
❌ Use copyrighted music  
❌ Record once and assume it's good (watch it back!)

## Remember

Your demo video is **PROOF**. It shows:
- "We actually built something" → Execution
- "It actually works" → Technical capability
- "It actually solves the problem" → Product-market fit

This is 60-90 seconds that represent 11 weeks of work. Make it count.

**Keep it simple. Show the product. Solve the problem. Done.**
