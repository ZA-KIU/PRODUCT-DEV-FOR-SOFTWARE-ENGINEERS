## Common Questions

**Q: What if I didn't complete a lab?**  
A: Use what you have. Be honest on the slide (e.g., "Validated through X interviews" where X is your actual number)

**Q: My Lab 10 unit economics are bad (LTV:CAC < 3:1). Should I fudge it?**  
A: NO. Show real numbers. Acknowledge it in pitch: "Our current metrics show [real numbers]. We're improving this by [strategy]."

**Q: We don't have a working MVP for the demo.**  
A: Show clickable prototype from Figma, or use screenshots with narration. Be honest: "Launching [date]."

**Q: What if our numbers aren't impressive?**  
A: Frame them correctly:
- "15 interviews" → ❌ Sounds small
- "Validated with 15 in-depth customer interviews" → ✅ Sounds thorough

**Q: Can I use different numbers than what's in my labs?**  
A: NO! Judges may check. Use actual data from your labs. If labs have errors, fix the labs first.

## Filing System

To make slide-building faster, organize your content:

```
/pitch-deck-content/
├── slide-2-problem/
│   ├── stats.txt (from Lab 4 synthesis)
│   ├── quotes.txt (from Lab 2-4 transcripts)
│   └── problem-headline.txt
├── slide-3-solution/
│   ├── solution-statement.txt
│   ├── key-features.txt (from Lab 6 PRD)
│   └── screenshot.png (from Lab 7)
├── slide-7-business/
│   ├── unit-economics.txt (COPY from Lab 10!)
│   └── pricing.txt (from Lab 9)
├── slide-8-traction/
│   └── all-metrics.txt (compile from Labs 2-10)
...
```

**Spend 15 minutes organizing content → Save 45 minutes building slides**

## Time-Saving Tips

1. **Don't start from scratch**
   - Copy/paste from your labs
   - Adapt wording for slides (shorter)
   - Numbers stay the same!

2. **Screenshot wisely**
   - Lab 7 screenshots ready to drop in
   - Choose best ones now (saves time later)
   - Crop if needed

3. **Batch similar slides**
   - Do all "stats slides" together (2, 6, 7, 8)
   - Then all "story slides" (1, 3, 5, 9, 10)
   - More efficient than jumping around

4. **One person compiles**
   - Have ONE teammate gather all lab content
   - Put in organized folder
   - Then team builds slides together
   - Avoids "where's that file?" chaos

## Remember

**Your pitch deck is not new work.**  
**It's 11 weeks of work, summarized.**

Every slide should reference actual experiments you ran, customers you talked to, and products you built.

**You've already done the hard part. Now just organize it into 10 slides!**
