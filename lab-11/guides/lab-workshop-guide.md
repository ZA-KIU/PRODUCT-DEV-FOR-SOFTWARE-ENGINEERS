[Conclude demo]
That's it. [X seconds] to [solve the problem]."

---

## SLIDE 5: Why Now [45 seconds]

"You might be wondering: why hasn't someone built this before?

And third, [your unique insight]. [Explain briefly]

The timing is perfect because [tie back to your target users' current situation]."

---

## SLIDE 6: Market [45 seconds]

"So how big is this opportunity?

[Point to TAM number]
There are [X thousand/million] [target users] in [geography] who face this problem daily.

We're starting with [SAM explanation - your serviceable market].

Year one, we're focused on [SOM - your specific target]. That's [X] users.

[annual revenue potential] in annual revenue within 12 months."

---

## SLIDE 7: Business Model [60 seconds]

"Here's how we make money.

Our model is [freemium/subscription/etc.]. [Explain briefly - 1 sentence]

[Point to unit economics]
Our unit economics are strong. We've validated through experiments in Lab 9 that:
• Lifetime Value is [X]
• Customer Acquisition Cost is [Y]  
• Giving us a [Z:1] LTV to CAC ratio

[Explain what this means]
That means for every lari we spend acquiring a user, we make [Z] lari back.

And our payback period is just [N] months, which is [healthy/strong] for [your industry]."

---

## SLIDE 8: Traction [60 seconds]

"So where are we today?

[Point to metrics]
This semester, we've:

• Built an MVP with [A] beta users
• [B]% are weekly active users
• And [C]% said they'd pay [price] per month

[Point to your photo]
I'm [name], [your background]. [One sentence on why you're qualified]

[Point to each teammate]
[Name 2] is our [role] with [credential]. 
[Name 3] brings [credential].
[Name 4] handles [role] and has [credential].

What makes us unique is [team's competitive advantage - domain expertise, 
technical skills, or lived experience with the problem].

We're not just building a product. We lived this problem for [X years]."

---

## SLIDE 10: The Ask [45 seconds]

"So here's what we're asking for.

[State the ask clearly]

If we get [resources/funding/support], here's what we'll do:

- Time yourself precisely
- Refine Q&A responses

### Week 15 (Dec 27)
**DEMO DAY!**

- Test A/V setup
- Deep breath
- Crush it 🚀

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "We're running behind schedule"

**If you're at 60 min and only have 5 slides:**
- Skip to Station 4: Record demo video first (most important!)
- Then finish slides 6-10 quickly (use bullet points, polish later)
- Peer review can be homework if needed

**If you're at 90 min and don't have demo video:**
- Record a 30-second version (just show ONE key feature)
- Plan to expand it in Week 13
- OR: Plan to do live demo and add note to Slide 4

### "Our MVP isn't working"

**Option 1: Screenshot Demo**
- Take screenshots of your best screens
- Create a "fake" walkthrough using screenshots
- Narrate over the screenshots
- Less impressive but better than nothing

**Option 2: Explain the Vision**
- Slide 4 becomes: "What We're Building"
- Show mockups/wireframes from Lab 6
- Be honest: "In development, launching [date]"
- Demo Day judges will understand

### "We don't have good metrics"

**Use what you have:**
- Number of interviews (Lab 2-4)
- Landing page signups (Lab 5)
- Validation experiments (Labs 8-9)
- Even small numbers are okay if honest

**Frame it right:**
- "Validated through 15 interviews" ✅
- Not: "Only talked to 15 people" ❌

### "Team disagreement on content"

**Quick vote:**
- 2 minutes discussion max
- Vote
- Majority wins
- Move on

**Remember:** Version 1 doesn't need to be perfect. You have 2 more weeks to refine!

---
