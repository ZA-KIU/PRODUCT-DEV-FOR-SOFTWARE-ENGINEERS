## ⚡ Critical Reminders

### ✅ DO This:

1. **Use REAL data from Labs 1-10**
   - Every number must trace back
   - Interview count, metrics, financials
   - No aspirational goals

2. **Show actual MVP**
   - Working product (even if basic)
   - Real screenshots, real demo
   - Not mockups (unless that's all you have)

3. **Be specific**
   - "500 users" not "lots of users"
   - "$45 LTV" not "good economics"
   - "6-month payback" not "fast"

4. **One complete story**
   - Problem → Solution → Business → Team → Ask
   - Each slide builds on previous
   - 10 minutes total

### ❌ DON'T Do This:

1. **Made-up numbers**
   - Judges may check your labs
   - Be honest even if small
   - Real > impressive

2. **Too many features**
   - Show ONE user flow in demo
   - List 3 features max per slide
   - Simple > comprehensive

3. **Copy template exactly**
   - Adapt to YOUR product
   - Use YOUR voice
   - YOUR data, YOUR story

4. **Skip the script**
   - You'll freeze on Demo Day
   - Practice requires script
   - 10 minutes is precise

## 🎯 Success Criteria

**You'll know you're done when:**

✅ Team can present without reading

## 🆘 Need Help?

### During Lab
- **Ask:** Professor or TA during stations
- **Reference:** Templates in `/templates/`
- **Quick lookup:** `guides/semester-to-slides-map.md`

### After Lab
- **Slack:** #lab-11-help
- **Office Hours:** Tue/Thu 2-4pm, Room K-305

### Common Issues

**"We're behind schedule"**
→ Record demo FIRST (most important), finish slides later

**"Our MVP isn't working"**
→ Use screenshots + narration, or Figma prototype

**"Numbers aren't impressive"**
→ Frame correctly: "15 interviews" → "validated through 15 in-depth interviews"

**"We disagree on content"**
→ Vote (2 min max), majority wins, move on
