**Year 5 Target Revenue: $____________**

**Justification for growth rates:**
_[Explain why these growth rates are realistic. Reference: market size, acquisition channels, unit economics, team capacity, etc.]_

### Step 2: Determine Exit Multiple

**Research on comparable companies:**

| Company | Industry | Stage | Annual Revenue | Valuation | Revenue Multiple |
|---------|----------|-------|----------------|-----------|------------------|
| [CompA] | _______ | _____ | $_______ | $_______ | ____x |
| [CompB] | _______ | _____ | $_______ | $_______ | ____x |
| [CompC] | _______ | _____ | $_______ | $_______ | ____x |
| [CompD] | _______ | _____ | $_______ | $_______ | ____x |
| [CompE] | _______ | _____ | $_______ | $_______ | ____x |

**Statistics:**
- Median Multiple: ____x
- Mean Multiple: ____x
- Range: ____x - ____x

**Our Selected Exit Multiple: ____x**

**Justification:**
_[Why did you choose this multiple? Is it median? Conservative? Optimistic? Why?]_

**Adjustments made:**
- ☐ Adjusted down because: ________________________________
- ☐ Adjusted up because: ________________________________
- ☐ Used median with no adjustments

---

### Step 3: Calculate Terminal Value

**Formula:** Terminal Value = Year 5 Revenue × Exit Multiple

```
Terminal Value = $_______ × ____x
Terminal Value = $____________
```

---

### Step 4: Apply Target ROI

**Our Stage:** ☐ Pre-seed (30x) | ☐ Seed (20x) | ☐ Series A (10-15x)

**Target ROI Selected: ____x**

**Justification:**
_[Why this ROI? Standard for stage? Adjusted for risk?]_

**Formula:** Pre-Money Valuation = Terminal Value / Target ROI

```
Pre-Money Valuation = $_______ / ____x
Pre-Money Valuation = $____________
```

---

### VC Method Result: $____________

---

## 📈 Method 2: Comparables (Sanity Check)

### Approach: Current Revenue × Median Multiple

**Our Current Annual Revenue:** $____________

**Median Comparable Multiple (from above):** ____x

**Calculation:**
```
Valuation = Current Revenue × Median Multiple
Valuation = $_______ × ____x
Valuation = $____________
```

### Comparables Result: $____________

---

## ⚖️ Reconciliation: VC Method vs. Comparables

| Method | Valuation | Difference |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| VC Method | $_______ | - |
| Comparables | $_______ | ____x |

**Difference Factor:** ____x (Comparables / VC Method)

**Analysis:**
- ☐ **Within 2x** - Good alignment, both methods confirm range
- ☐ **2-3x apart** - Some divergence, need to review assumptions
- ☐ **>3x apart** - Significant gap, likely error in assumptions

**If >2x apart, explanation:**
_[Why are they different? Which one is more reliable? What assumptions need revisiting?]_

## 🎲 Sensitivity Analysis

### Scenario 1: Pessimistic (Conservative Case)

**Assumptions:**
- Year 5 Revenue: $_______ (____% lower than base)
- Exit Multiple: ____x (conservative)
- Target ROI: ____x (higher risk premium)

**Calculation:**
```
Terminal Value = $_______ × ____x = $_______
Pre-Money Valuation = $_______ / ____x = $____________
```

**Pessimistic Valuation: $____________**

---

### Scenario 2: Base Case (Most Likely)

**This is our primary VC Method calculation from above.**

**Base Case Valuation: $____________**

---

### Scenario 3: Optimistic (Best Case)

**Assumptions:**
- Year 5 Revenue: $_______ (____% higher than base)
- Exit Multiple: ____x (hot market, strong growth)
- Target ROI: ____x (proven execution, lower risk)

**Calculation:**
```
Terminal Value = $_______ × ____x = $_______
Pre-Money Valuation = $_______ / ____x = $____________
```

**Optimistic Valuation: $____________**

---

### Sensitivity Summary Table

| Scenario | Year 5 Rev | Exit Multiple | Terminal Value | ROI | Pre-Money Valuation |
|----------|------------|---------------|----------------|-----|---------------------|
| **Pessimistic** | $_______ | ____x | $_______ | ____x | **$_______** |
| **Base Case** | $_______ | ____x | $_______ | ____x | **$_______** |
| **Optimistic** | $_______ | ____x | $_______ | ____x | **$_______** |

**Valuation Range: $_______ - $_______**
