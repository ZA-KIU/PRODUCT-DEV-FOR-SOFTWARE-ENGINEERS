# Decision Frameworks

This document summarizes the four filters used during problem selection in Lab 2. Each framework helps evaluate potential problems objectively.

## Hair on Fire Test
- **Purpose:** Assess how painful the problem is for users and whether they urgently seek solutions.
- **Scoring (0–5):**
  - **5 – Severe pain:** People desperately need a solution.
  - **3 – Annoying:** People tolerate the problem but wish for something better.
  - **1 – Mild:** It's a minor inconvenience; a solution would be nice but not essential.
- **Use:** Ask whether the problem causes significant frustration, lost time, or serious consequences if left unsolved.

## Access Test
- **Purpose:** Evaluate how easily your team can reach people who experience the problem.
- **Scoring (0–5):**
  - **5 – Easy access:** You know 20+ people you can contact immediately.
  - **3 – Moderate:** You can find about 10 people with some effort.
  - **1 – Hard:** The user segment is difficult to reach or outside your network.
- **Use:** Consider the channels (classes, online groups, contacts) where you can find and interview potential users.

## Feasibility Test
- **Purpose:** Determine whether you can build a meaningful MVP in 8–10 weeks with available skills and resources.
- **Scoring (0–5):**
  - **5 – Highly feasible:** The team has the skills, and the solution is straightforward.
  - **3 – Challenging but doable:** Requires learning some new skills but still achievable.
  - **1 – Unfeasible:** Requires expertise or resources beyond what the team can acquire in time.
- **Use:** Assess technical complexity, scope, and any dependencies that could hinder progress.

## Team Energy Test
- **Purpose:** Measure team interest and motivation for working on the problem.
- **Scoring (0–5):**
  - **5 – High energy:** Everyone is excited and committed.
  - **3 – Mixed:** Some members are enthusiastic; others are neutral.
  - **1 – Low:** Only one or two members care, and others have little interest.
- **Use:** Discuss which problems resonate with the team’s passions and align with personal goals. High motivation often leads to better outcomes.

### How to Use These Frameworks
1. Identify the top 3–4 candidate problems based on initial brainstorming and voting.
2. Rate each problem on the four criteria above, using a score from 0 to 5.
3. Calculate the total score (out of 20) for each problem.
4. Compare totals and select the problem with the highest score; if close, discuss qualitative factors.
5. Document the scores and rationale in your team problem statement.

These frameworks ensure your team selects a problem that is painful, accessible, feasible, and motivating to pursue.
