## Decision-Making Process

### Our Primary Decision Method: Consensus with Vote Fallback

**How it works:**
- We discuss until everyone understands all perspectives (minimum 15 minutes discussion)
- We seek consensus - everyone agrees on the path forward
- If no consensus after 30 minutes, we vote (simple majority wins)
- Person who disagreed with majority can record dissent in meeting notes
- Once decision is made, everyone commits to it regardless of personal preference

**Exception - Role-Based Authority for Urgent Decisions:**
- Tech emergencies (code broken, deployment issues) â†’ Tech Lead decides
- Interview scheduling conflicts â†’ Discovery Lead decides
- Missed deadlines, schedule conflicts â†’ Program Lead decides

### Escalation Path:
If we cannot reach a decision using consensus + vote:
1. Sleep on it, revisit next day with fresh perspective
2. Seek input from another team as neutral third party
3. Escalate to instructor for mediation

## Work Expectations

**How we'll track contributions:**
- **GitHub commits** with detailed commit messages
- **Shared Notion Task Board** (updated by Friday each week)

**Our Notion board sections:**

- This Week (committed tasks)
- In Progress (actively working on)
- Review (needs team review)
- Done (completed)

### Quality Standards:
- All code must be reviewed by at least 1 other team member before merging to main
- All research deliverables reviewed by Discovery Lead before submission
- Documentation updated within 24 hours of any code changes
- Interview logs completed within 24 hours of interview
- All deliverables reviewed by at least one team member before submission

### Individual Accountability:
Each member commits to:

## Conflict Resolution

### Our Conflict Resolution Process:

**Step 1: Direct Conversation (24-48 hours)**
- People involved discuss directly, in private (in-person or 1:1 call)
- Use "I feel..." statements, not "You always..." accusations
- Focus on specific behaviors, not personal attacks
- Seek to understand before being understood
- Goal: Reach mutual agreement on path forward

**Step 2: Mediation by Third Team Member (24-48 hours)**
- If Step 1 fails, bring in neutral team member as mediator
- Mediator listens to both sides, does not take sides
- Mediator helps identify areas of agreement and compromise
- Mediator documents agreed-upon solution
- Goal: Find compromise both parties can accept

**Step 3: Escalation to Instructor (If needed)**
- If Steps 1-2 fail or conflict is affecting team's work
- Document: What's the conflict? What have you tried? What outcome do you want?
- Program Lead contacts instructor to request mediation
- Instructor provides guidance or facilitates resolution

### Types of Conflicts & How We'll Handle Them:

**Missed Deadlines:**
1. Person explains reason in team WhatsApp within 24 hours of missing deadline
2. Team decides: Can deadline be extended? Or should work be redistributed?
3. If pattern emerges (3+ missed deadlines), team discusses workload redistribution
4. Peer review may reflect consistent missed deadlines

**Unequal Contribution:**
1. Program Lead monitors via Notion board and standup reports
2. If contribution imbalance noticed, Program Lead has 1:1 conversation with person
3. If persists, discuss as full team in private meeting
4. If still persists, adjust peer review scores and document in mid-term peer assessment

**Technical Disagreements:**
1. Both sides document their approach (pros, cons, tradeoffs) in GitHub issue
2. Team discusses at next meeting
3. Tech Lead researches both options if needed
4. Team votes if no consensus
5. Document decision and reasoning for future reference

**Personal Conflicts:**
1. Follow 3-step process above (Direct â†’ Mediated â†’ Escalated)
2. Keep it professional - focus on work, not personalities
3. If conflict is affecting team dynamics, address immediately (don't let it fester)
