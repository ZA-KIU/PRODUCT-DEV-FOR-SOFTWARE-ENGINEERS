## Overview

**Problem We're Solving:** 
CS students struggle to effectively coordinate multi-person group projects, leading to duplicated work, missed contributions, unclear task ownership, and last-minute scrambles.

**Our ICP In One Sentence:**  
Second- and third-year Computer Science students at KIU taking 3+ courses with concurrent group project deadlines who currently coordinate using multiple disconnected tools (WhatsApp, Google Drive, GitHub).

---

---

## Behavioral Characteristics

### Relationship with the Problem

**Frequency:** Multiple times per day during active project phases
- Checks project status 3-5 times per day
- Coordinates with team members 5-10 times per day via messages
- Experiences coordination friction 2-4 times per week

**Duration:** Ongoing problem throughout academic career
- Experienced this problem in at least 5-10 previous group projects
- Will continue experiencing it for 2-4 more semesters
- Gets worse as number of concurrent projects increases

### Current Behaviors

**What they currently do when coordination issues arise:**

1. **For quick questions:** Send WhatsApp message to group chat
   - Checks WhatsApp 20-30 times per day
   - Often misses important messages in busy chats
   - Hard to find information later

2. **For status updates:** 
   - Post in group chat "I finished X"
   - Often forgotten or buried
   - No persistent visibility into status

3. **For file sharing:**
   - Upload to Google Drive
   - Link sharing in WhatsApp
   - Version confusion common

4. **For code:**
   - GitHub (if team is comfortable with Git)
   - Google Drive shared folder (if not comfortable with Git)
   - Email attachments (worst case)

5. **For planning:**
   - Initial meeting to divide work
   - Usually no follow-up until near deadline
   - Assumes everyone remembers their assignments

6. **When things go wrong:**
   - Frantic last-minute messages
   - Emergency in-person meetings
   - One person (usually same person) takes over and consolidates

**Tools/methods they currently use:**
- WhatsApp (primary communication)
- Google Drive (document collaboration)
- GitHub (code, if team uses it)
- Occasional Telegram or Facebook Messenger
- Email (formal communication)
- In-person meetings (difficult to schedule)

**Where they go for help:**
- Ask teammates in group chat
- Ask friends in other project teams
- Google for project management advice (often find tools too complex)
- Sometimes ask professor (usually about content, not coordination)

### Motivation & Pain Tolerance

**How motivated are they to solve this?**
✅ **Would use solution if available**

**Evidence:**
- Complain frequently about coordination chaos
- Willing to try new tools if they actually work
- BUT skeptical because they've tried other tools that were too complex
- Need to see value immediately (won't invest time in steep learning curve)

**What's their pain tolerance?**
☑️ **Medium** - Will try solutions but not desperately seeking

**Reasoning:**
- Problem is chronic and frustrating BUT...
- They've learned to cope with current inefficient methods
- Last-minute scrambles are normalized ("that's just how group projects work")
- Pain level spikes near deadlines, otherwise tolerable

### Tech Savviness

**Technical comfort level:**
✅ **Moderately comfortable (uses common tools)**

**Specific technical profile:**
- Can easily sign up for and use web apps
- Comfortable with mobile apps
- Familiar with basic project management concepts
- Some experience with GitHub (varying levels)
- NOT expecting them to:
  - Self-host tools
  - Configure complex systems
  - Read technical documentation extensively
  - Spend hours learning a new tool

**Implications for solution design:**
- Must be intuitive without extensive tutorials
- Should work on both desktop and mobile
- Should feel familiar (pattern of tools they already use)
- Should integrate with tools they already use (not replace them)
- Simple onboarding (under 5 minutes to first value)

## Context & Constraints

### When Does Problem Occur?

**Time of day:** 
- Throughout the day but peaks in evening (7-11 PM) when students do project work
- Weekend afternoons (2-6 PM) when team members try to sync up
- Last-minute late nights before deadline (11 PM - 2 AM)

**Day of week:** 
- Weekdays: Ongoing low-level coordination
- Weekends: Heavier project work, more coordination needed
- Sunday nights: Peak panic as deadlines approach

**Time of semester:** 
- Weeks 1-3: Low (projects just starting)
- Weeks 4-8: Medium-High (mid-project phase)
- Weeks 6-8: Peak (midterm project deadlines)
- Weeks 9-12: Medium (new projects starting)
- Weeks 13-15: Peak (final project deadlines)

**Triggering event:** 
- Starting work on project task
- Trying to integrate work with teammates
- Realizing someone's contribution is missing/unclear
- Deadline approaching and status unknown
- Professor asking for progress update

### Where Does Problem Occur?

**Physical location:** 
- Home/dorm while working remotely
- Library study areas (trying to work individually or meet with team)
- Computer labs
- Cafeteria (informal team meetings)
- Commute (checking status on mobile)

**Digital environment:** 
- Primarily mobile (checking WhatsApp, status updates)
- Desktop/laptop for actual project work
- Mix of Windows, Mac, some Linux
- Chrome browser most common

**Social context:** 
- Usually working independently (not co-located with team)
- Occasional in-person team sessions
- Async coordination is the norm

### What Are They Trying to Accomplish?

**Broader goal (JTBD):** 

When starting project work session, CS students want to quickly know what's been completed, what's in progress, and what they should work on next, so they can contribute effectively without duplicating work or missing dependencies.

**Breaking it down:**
- **Situation:** Starting a project work session (evening study time, weekend afternoon, etc.)
- **Motivation:** Know current status, what to work on, any blockers
- **Desired Outcome:** Make meaningful progress without coordination overhead

**Additional JTBD:**

When approaching a project deadline, CS students want to see complete status of all tasks and outstanding work, so they can identify gaps and complete project without last-minute panic.

### Constraints They Face

**Time constraints:** 
- Limited time for actual project work (competing courses, exams, social life)
- Can't afford 2-4 hours per week just on coordination overhead
- Need to see value from any new tool within first use (no time for extensive learning)

**Money constraints:** 
- Student budgets (minimal or no money for tools)
- Expect free tools or very cheap (<5 GEL/month)
- Unlikely to pay before seeing clear value

**Authority constraints:** 
- Can't change course structure or project requirements
- Can't force teammates to use specific tools
- Limited influence over team processes
- Must work within what team agrees to

**Technical constraints:** 
- Not all team members equally tech-savvy
- Some team members resist new tools
- Different devices and platforms across team
- Limited control over what tools teammates prefer

**Social constraints:** 
- Don't want to be seen as "controlling" or "micro-managing"
- Prefer consensus-based decisions
- Hesitant to push teammates to change behavior
- Fear of being "that person" who makes things complicated

---

## Primary Pain Point

**In 1-2 sentences:**

Second- and third-year CS students taking 3+ concurrent project courses spend 2-4 hours per week coordinating across disconnected tools (WhatsApp, Google Drive, GitHub) instead of doing actual project work, resulting in duplicated effort, last-minute integration scrambles, and high stress levels near deadlines because there's no single source of truth for task status and team progress.

## Screener Questions

**To verify someone matches our ICP, we'll ask:**

1. **"What year are you in the CS program?"**
   - ✅ Must be: Second year or Third year
   - ❌ Not: First year or Fourth year

2. **"How many courses are you taking this semester that have group projects?"**
   - ✅ Must be: 3 or more
   - ❌ Not: Fewer than 3 (not experiencing enough pain)

3. **"Are you currently working on at least one group project right now?"**
   - ✅ Must be: Yes (actively experiencing the problem)
   - ❌ Not: No, between projects (can't recall pain as vividly)

**If they answer YES to all three screener questions → They match our ICP perfectly.**

**If they're close but not exact:** (e.g., third-year with only 2 group projects)
- Still interview them, but note the difference
- Their perspective still valuable but might have less pain

---

## Quality Checks

## Notes & Observations

**Key insights about this ICP:**

1. **They're the "Goldilocks" segment:**
   - First-years don't have enough projects yet (not painful enough)
   - Fourth-years have thesis, different problem (not enough projects)
   - Second/third-years have MAXIMUM number of concurrent group projects
   
2. **They're solution-aware but skeptical:**
   - Have tried other tools (Trello, Asana) and found them too complex
   - Need to see immediate value
   - Won't invest time in learning curve
   
3. **They're tech-capable but not tech-eager:**
   - Can use new tools BUT
   - Default to simplest option that "good enough"
   - Need tool to be obviously better than current chaos
   
4. **Coordination pain is normalized:**
   - They think "this is just how group projects are"
   - Might not realize it could be better
   - Need to help them see there's a better way

5. **Team dynamics matter:**
   - Can't force teammates to use tools
   - Solution must be easy enough that whole team adopts
   - One person using it isn't enough

**Implications for MVP:**
- Must be dead simple (5-minute onboarding max)
- Must show value in first use (immediate gratification)
- Must integrate with (not replace) WhatsApp and Google Drive
- Must work well on mobile (they live on their phones)
- Must feel lightweight (not like "project management overhead")
