## SECTION 1: Opening & Rapport (3-5 minutes)

**Opening:**
"Hi [name], thanks so much for meeting with me. Really appreciate you taking the time."

**Introduction:**
"I'm [your name], a [year] CS student here at KIU. I'm working on a class project for Product Development where we're exploring how students handle group projects—specifically the coordination and organization side of things.

I want to emphasize: I'm not here to pitch you any solution or sell anything. I'm purely trying to learn about your experiences with group projects. There are no right or wrong answers—I genuinely just want to understand how things work for you."

**Logistics:**
"This should take about 20-25 minutes. Does that still work for you?"

[Wait for confirmation]

"Perfect. Is it okay if I record this on my phone? It just helps me remember everything accurately instead of trying to frantically write notes while we talk. This recording won't be shared outside our team."

[Wait for permission]

"Great, starting recording now. Ready? Again, super casual—I just want to hear about your real experiences."

---

## SECTION 2: Context & Background (5-7 minutes)

### Screener Questions:

"Before we dive in, let me just confirm a few things:"

**Q1:** "You're a [second/third]-year CS student, right?"

**Q2:** "And how many courses are you taking this semester that have group project components?"

[MUST BE 3+. If less than 3, note it but can continue if they're close]

**Q3:** "Are you actively working on at least one group project right now?"

[MUST BE YES. If no, ask when their last group project was—ideally within past month]

---

### Context Questions:

"Great, so you're definitely in the thick of it. Let me understand a bit about your setup."

**Q4:** "Tell me about your typical week. What's your schedule like—classes, study time, other commitments?"

[LISTEN: This gives context about time constraints, when they work on projects]

**Q5:** "So you mentioned you have [X] group projects this semester. What courses are those for?"

[LISTEN: Noting specific courses helps understand context]

**Q6:** "Just to get a sense—what size are these project teams typically? Like 2 people, 3 people, 5 people?"

[LISTEN: Team size affects coordination complexity]

**Q7:** "When you're working on these projects, where are you usually doing the work? At home, library, somewhere else?"

[LISTEN: Physical location affects coordination approach]

**Q8:** "And how do your teams typically communicate and coordinate? Like what apps or tools do you usually use?"

[LISTEN: This sets up Section 3. Note all tools they mention.]

---

## SECTION 3: Problem Deep Dive (10-15 minutes) ⭐ MOST IMPORTANT

### The Opening Story Question:

"Okay, now I want to really understand how the coordination side of group projects works for you. Let me ask you this:"

**MAIN QUESTION:**
"Think about this past week. Tell me about the last time you needed to coordinate with your team about one of your group projects—like figure out who's doing what, check on status, share work, whatever it was. 

Walk me through exactly what happened, from start to finish."

[⚠️ STOP TALKING. Let them tell the full story. Take detailed notes. Only use minimal encouragers: "mm-hmm," "I see," "go on"]

---

### Follow-Up Probes:

[Use these based on their story. Don't ask all—pick the relevant ones]

**Digging Deeper on What They Said:**

"You mentioned [specific thing they said—like 'I checked WhatsApp']. Tell me more about that. What were you looking for?"

"What happened next after that?"

"How long did that whole process take, from when you started to when you finished?"

[If they estimate time] "What made it take that long?"

**Five Whys Series:**

"You said it was [frustrating/confusing/time-consuming]. Why was that?"

[Wait for answer]

"And why does [their answer] happen?"

[Wait for answer]

"Why is [their previous answer] such a problem?"

[Wait for answer]

"What's the underlying reason that causes [root issue they mentioned]?"

**Emotional Impact:**

"When that was happening, how did you feel?"

"You used the word '[frustrated/stressed/confused]'—can you describe that feeling a bit more?"

"Has this type of situation affected your mood or stress level about group projects in general?"

**Consequences:**

"What was the impact of [thing they described]? Did it affect anything else?"

"What would have happened if you hadn't [done the workaround they mentioned]?"

"Did this affect your ability to work on the actual project, or your other coursework?"

"You mentioned it took [X time]—what else could you have done with that time?"

**Exploring Patterns:**

"Has something like this happened before? Tell me about another recent time."

"Think about this past week—Monday through today. How many times have you had to deal with coordination issues like this?"

[If they give a number] "Walk me through one specific time."

"Is it always like this, or does it vary? What makes coordination better or worse?"

**Specific to Their Story - Group Project Coordination:**

"You mentioned your team uses [WhatsApp/Google Drive/etc]. What specifically about [that tool] makes coordination hard?"

"When you're trying to figure out what everyone's working on, where do you check? Does that usually work?"

"Have you ever done duplicate work—like worked on something not knowing someone else was already doing it? Tell me about that."

"Have you ever missed knowing someone finished their part? What happened?"

"Tell me about the last time your team had a deadline coming up. How did you know if you were on track or behind?"

"When someone on your team doesn't respond to messages, what do you typically do?"

"Have you ever been the person trying to consolidate everyone's work at the last minute? Walk me through what that was like."

**Root Cause Exploration:**

"Why do you think it's so hard to stay coordinated as a team?"

"What would need to change to make coordination smoother?"

"If you could wave a magic wand and fix one thing about how your team coordinates, what would it be? Why that specifically?"

**Comparing to Ideal:**

"Think about a group project that went smoothly from a coordination standpoint—if you've had one. What made that one work better?"

[If they can't think of one] "Yeah, that's interesting. Why do you think none have gone smoothly?"

---

### Additional Probing Questions (Use if relevant):

"Do all your project teams coordinate the same way, or is each team different?"

"Does anyone on your teams ever take the role of organizing or coordinating? How does that person end up in that role?"

"When your team divides up the work at the beginning of a project, how do you usually decide who does what?"

"After dividing work, how often do you check in with each other? What prompts those check-ins?"

"Have you ever felt like you were doing more than your fair share in a group project? How did you know?"

"Have you ever felt unclear about what you were supposed to be doing? Tell me about that."

---

## SECTION 4: Current Solutions & Workarounds (3-5 minutes)

**Current Approach:**
"So when coordination gets messy—like what you just described—what do you typically do to handle it?"

[LISTEN: Their workarounds]

**Follow-ups:**

"How long have you been coordinating projects this way?"

"What works well about using [WhatsApp/their tools]?"

"What doesn't work? What are the pain points?"

"Have you or your teams tried other tools or methods? Like have you tried Trello, Asana, Notion, anything like that?"

[If yes] "Tell me about that. What made you try it? What happened? Why did you stop using it or why didn't it stick?"

[If no] "Have you thought about trying other tools? What's held you back?"

"If you could improve one thing about how you currently coordinate projects, what would it be?"

**Gauging Value:**

"On a scale of 1-10, where 1 is 'barely bothers me' and 10 is 'this is a huge problem,' how much does coordination chaos affect your group project experience?"

[Wait for number]

"Why that number? What makes it a [X] rather than higher or lower?"

"If there was a solution that made coordination significantly easier, how valuable would that be to you and your teams?"

---

## SECTION 5: Closing & Next Steps (2-3 minutes)

**Gratitude:**
"This has been super helpful. Thank you so much for walking me through all of that. You've given me a much clearer picture of what coordination actually looks like day-to-day."

**Referrals:**
"Quick question: Do you know any other second or third-year CS students who also have multiple group projects going on? People who might be willing to talk with me for 20 minutes like this?"

[If yes] "That would be amazing. Would you be comfortable making an intro, or should I reach out and mention that you referred me?"

[Get names/contact if they offer]

**Future Contact:**
"One last thing: If we end up building something to help with project coordination, would you be interested in trying it out and giving feedback? Totally no pressure—just curious if you'd be open to it."

[If yes] "Great! What's the best way to reach you?"

**Get Contact Info:**

## Notes for Interviewer

**Things that went well in pilot interviews:**
- Asking "walk me through exactly what happened" gets great stories
- The Five Whys series about "why was that frustrating" reaches root causes
- Asking about specific tools (WhatsApp, Google Drive) triggers memories
- Asking about "last-minute consolidation" gets emotional responses

**Things to improve:**
- Don't rush Section 3—let them talk for 12-15 minutes if they're on a roll
- When they say "we use WhatsApp," dig deeper: "What specifically about WhatsApp makes coordination hard?"
- If they say "it's fine" about coordination, ask about the last deadline crunch
- Practice letting silence happen— they'll keep talking

**Common patterns emerging (update as we do more interviews):**
- Everyone mentions WhatsApp burying messages
- Many mention "one person ends up doing everything"
- "Last minute scramble" is universal experience
- Nobody has found a tool that works—most tried Trello but found it too complex
