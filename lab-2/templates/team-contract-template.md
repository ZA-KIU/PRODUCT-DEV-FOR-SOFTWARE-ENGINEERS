## Conflict Resolution

**Step 2: Mediation by Third Team Member (24-48 hours)**
- If Step 1 fails, bring in neutral team member
- Mediator helps facilitate conversation
- Team member does not take sides, just helps communication
- Goal: Find compromise

**Step 3: Escalation to Instructor (If needed)**

- Document: What's the conflict? What have you tried? What outcome do you want?
- Instructor provides guidance or mediation

### Types of Conflicts & How We'll Handle Them:

**Missed Deadlines:**
[Your team's approach, e.g., "Person explains reason → Team redistributes work → Adjust future assignments"]

**Unequal Contribution:**

**Technical Disagreements:**
