## Pre-Interview Checklist

Before starting the interview:
- [ ] Confirmed interviewee matches ICP (screener questions)
- [ ] Scheduled 25-30 minutes
- [ ] Prepared recording device OR note-taking setup
- [ ] Reviewed script (but won't read it robotically)

---

## SECTION 1: Opening & Rapport (3-5 minutes)

### Goals:
- Build trust and comfort
- Set clear expectations
- Get permission to record/take notes
- Lower stakes (no right/wrong answers)

### Script:

**Opening:**
"Hi [name], thanks so much for taking the time to talk with me today. I really appreciate it."

**Introduction:**
"I'm [your name], a [year] student in the Computer Science program here at KIU. I'm working on a class project about [YOUR PROBLEM AREA - don't reveal solution].

I'm trying to learn about [SPECIFIC ASPECT OF PROBLEM] from people who [DESCRIBE ICP EXPERIENCE].

I want to emphasize: I'm not here to sell you anything or pitch an idea. I'm purely here to learn about your experiences. There are no right or wrong answers—I just want to understand your reality."

**Logistics:**
"This should take about 20 minutes, maybe 25. Is that still okay?"

[Wait for confirmation]

"Great. Is it okay if I [record this / take notes]? It just helps me remember what you said accurately instead of relying on my memory. I won't share this outside our class team."

[Wait for permission - if they say no to recording, that's fine, just take detailed notes]

"Perfect. Ready to start? Again, super casual—just want to hear about your experiences."

## SECTION 2: Context & Background (5-7 minutes)

### Goals:
- Verify they match ICP
- Understand their routine and context
- Build rapport with easy questions
- Gather context that will inform later questions

### Screener Questions (verify ICP match):

"Before we dive in, let me just confirm a few quick things:"

1. [YOUR SCREENER QUESTION 1]
   - Example: "You're a third-year CS student, right?"

2. [YOUR SCREENER QUESTION 2]
   - Example: "And you're taking [X number] courses this semester?"

3. [YOUR SCREENER QUESTION 3 - if needed]
   - Example: "Do you use [relevant tool/system]?"

**If they don't match ICP:** Thank them warmly, explain they're not quite the right fit for this specific research, and ask if they know anyone who does match. Wrap up gracefully.

**If they match:** Continue below.

### Context Questions:

"Great, that's helpful to know. Now I want to understand a bit about your routine and how you [RELEVANT ACTIVITY]."

**Question 1: General Routine**
"Tell me about your typical week. What's a normal [Tuesday/weekday] like for you?"

[Listen. Take notes. This gives you context about their life.]

**Question 2: Relevant Context**
"How do you usually [ACTIVITY RELATED TO YOUR PROBLEM]?"

Example: "How do you usually keep track of assignments and course materials?"

**Question 3: Environment/Setup**
"Where do you typically [DO THE ACTIVITY]? And what tools or methods do you use?"

Example: "Where do you usually study? And how do you access course materials—laptop, phone, both?"

**Question 4: Frequency**
"About how often would you say you [ACTIVITY] in a typical week?"

[These questions are setting up context. Don't dig deep yet—that's Section 3.]

### The Opening Story Question:

Walk me through exactly what happened, step by step."

**Example:** "Tell me about the last time you needed to find course materials in the LMS. Walk me through exactly what happened—from the moment you realized you needed to find something to when you finally got it."

[⚠️ CRITICAL: Stop talking. Let them tell the story. Take detailed notes. Don't interrupt except to encourage: "Mm-hmm," "I see," "Go on."]

---

### Follow-Up Probes (Use as relevant - don't ask all):

**Dig Deeper on Their Story:**

1. "You mentioned [SPECIFIC THING THEY SAID]. Tell me more about that."

2. "When that happened, what did you do next?"

14. "Think about this past week—Monday through today. How many times did something like this happen?"
    - If they give a number: "Walk me through one specific time."

**Exploring Variations:**

15. "Is it always like that, or does it vary? What makes it better or worse?"

16. "When does this problem tend to be worst? Best?"

**Root Cause Investigation:**

17. "Why do you think this problem exists?"

18. "What would need to change to fix this?"

### Tips for Section 3:
- ⚠️ This section should take 10-15 minutes minimum. Don't rush.
- ⚠️ Follow interesting threads. If they mention something emotional or surprising, dig into it.
- ⚠️ Use silence. After they answer, wait 3 seconds before asking next question. They'll often add more.
- ⚠️ Capture exact quotes. When they say something insightful, write it down word-for-word.
- ⚠️ If they generalize ("This always happens"), ask for specific recent example.
- ⚠️ If they start pitching you a solution, gently redirect: "That's interesting. Before we talk about solutions, I want to make sure I understand the problem fully. Tell me more about [redirect to story]."

---

## SECTION 4: Current Solutions & Workarounds (3-5 minutes)

### Goals:
- Understand what they currently do (this is your competition)
- Identify pain points in current solutions
- Gauge how motivated they are to solve this

### Questions:

**Current Approach:**
"So when [YOUR PROBLEM] happens, what do you typically do?"

[Listen. This reveals their current solution.]

**Follow-ups:**

1. "How long have you been doing it that way?"

2. "What works well about that approach?"

3. "What doesn't work? What are the downsides?"

4. "Have you tried other ways of handling this?"
   - If yes: "Tell me about those. What made you stop using them?"

5. "Do you use any specific tools or apps for this?"
   - If yes: "Which ones? What do you like/dislike about them?"

6. "If you could improve one thing about how you currently handle this, what would it be?"

**Gauging Motivation:**

7. "On a scale of 1-10, how much does this problem bother you? Why that number?"

8. "If there was a solution to this, how valuable would that be to you?"
   - [⚠️ Don't ask about price here—just gauging value perception]

- Thank them genuinely

**Referrals:**
"Quick question: Do you know anyone else who [MATCHES YOUR ICP] who might also be willing to talk with me? I'm trying to talk to about 10 people to really understand this problem."

[If they give names: "Would you be comfortable making an introduction, or should I reach out and mention you referred me?"]

**Future Contact:**
"One more thing: If we do end up building something to address this problem, would you be open to trying it out and giving feedback? No obligation—just curious."

## Notes for Using This Script

**Remember:**
- ✅ This is a GUIDE, not a rigid questionnaire
- ✅ You'll deviate based on what they say—that's good
- ✅ Follow interesting threads even if it means skipping questions
- ✅ Listen more than you talk (80/20 rule)
- ✅ Capture exact quotes in quotation marks
- ✅ Ask "Why?" and "Tell me more" frequently

**Don't:**
- ❌ Read questions like a robot
- ❌ Interrupt their stories
- ❌ Pitch your solution
- ❌ Ask leading questions
- ❌ Accept surface answers without digging deeper
- ❌ Fill every silence immediately

**The goal is INSIGHTS, not completing the script perfectly.**
