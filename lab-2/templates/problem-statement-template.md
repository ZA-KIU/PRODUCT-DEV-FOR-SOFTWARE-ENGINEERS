# Problem Statement Template

**Instructions:** Use this template to document EACH problem idea. Each team member should create 3 of these.

---

## Problem Title

[Give your problem a short, memorable name]

---

## Problem Description

### The Problem (1-2 sentences)

[Describe the problem clearly and concisely]

Example: "Students waste significant time navigating the LMS to find course materials because content organization varies by professor."

### Who Experiences It

[Describe the user segment - be specific]

Example: "Third-year Computer Science students taking 5+ concurrent courses"

NOT: "Students" (too broad)

### When/Where Does It Occur

[Context: When and where does this problem happen?]

Example: "When students need to find lecture slides, assignments, or announcements before studying or starting homework"

---

## Why It Matters

### Pain Level

[Rate the pain: Low / Medium / High]

[Explain: Is this a minor annoyance or a significant problem?]

### Frequency

[How often does this problem occur?]

Example: "Daily - students check LMS multiple times per day across multiple courses"

### Consequences

[What happens when this problem occurs? What's the impact?]

Example: 
- Wastes 10-20 minutes per study session
- Students miss important announcements
- Frustration leads to avoiding LMS entirely

---

## Current Solutions

### What People Do Now

[How do people currently handle this problem?]

Example:
- Ask classmates in WhatsApp groups
- Email professors directly
- Create personal filing systems
- Give up and work with incomplete information

### Gaps in Current Solutions

[What doesn't work about current approaches?]

Example:
- WhatsApp isn't reliable (depends on others)
- Email takes time (professor response delay)
- Personal systems break when professors reorganize

---

## Evidence

### What Makes You Think This is Real?

[Any evidence you have so far - even anecdotal]

Examples:
- "I experience this daily"
- "5 friends have complained about this"
- "Observed in Database Systems class"
- "Professor mentioned this in Week 1"

### Initial Observations

[What have you noticed? Quote specific examples if possible]

---

## Feasibility Assessment

### Technical Feasibility

[Can we build something to address this in 8-10 weeks?]

[What would an MVP look like?]

Example: "A browser extension that reorganizes LMS content by date/importance - technically feasible with web dev skills"

### Access to Users

[Can we find 10+ people who experience this problem at KIU?]

[Where would we find them?]

Example: "Yes - can find 20+ third-year CS students in our classes, library, student lounge"

## Initial Ideas (Optional)

[If you have early solution ideas, note them here - but remember, these are HYPOTHESES to validate through interviews, not commitments]
