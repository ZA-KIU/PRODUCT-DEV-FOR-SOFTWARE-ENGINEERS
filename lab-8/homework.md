## 💡 Tips for Success

### Do's
✅ Start experiment early in the week (Monday/Tuesday)
✅ Track data daily - don't wait until the end
✅ Be honest about negative results (they're still learning)
✅ Talk to users, not just collect clicks
✅ Document as you go, not at the end

### Don'ts
❌ Don't fake data or inflate numbers
❌ Don't ignore results that contradict your assumptions
❌ Don't skip the analysis - raw data isn't enough
❌ Don't change experiment mid-way without documenting why
❌ Don't wait until last minute to start

### If Things Go Wrong
- **Can't recruit enough users?** Document why, try alternative channels, smaller sample is okay if you explain limitations
- **Technical issues?** Document the problem, show your workaround, explain impact on results
- **Results inconclusive?** That's okay! Document what you learned and design follow-up experiment
- **Complete failure?** GREAT! Document learnings and pivot. Failure with learning is success in this class.

## 🆘 Getting Help

### Office Hours
**When:** Tuesdays 2-4 PM  
**Where:** [Location]  
**Bring:** Your experiment plan and any early data

### Slack Channel
`#lab-8-questions`  
Post questions, share progress, help each other

### Common Issues

**Q: Our experiment isn't getting enough participants**
A: Lower your sample size requirement (with justification), try new channels, or pivot to different experiment type

**Q: Results contradict what we expected**
A: Perfect! That's the point. Document the surprise and what it means.

**Q: We don't know if results are "good enough"**
A: Compare to your success criteria from lab. If you hit the threshold, it's validated. If not, it's not. Document either way.

**Q: Can we change our experiment mid-way?**
A: Only if you have a very good reason. Document the change and rationale clearly.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

After completing this homework, you will have:

✅ Real data about your product assumptions  
✅ Experience running lean experiments  
✅ Practice making evidence-based decisions  
✅ Refined product direction based on learning  
✅ Muscle memory for the Build-Measure-Learn cycle  

**This is where theory becomes practice. Make it count!**

---

## 🚀 What's Next: Lab 9

After completing your validation experiments, you'll move into financial modeling:

**Lab 9 (Week 11): Unit Economics & Financial Modeling**
- Calculate LTV (Lifetime Value) and CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)
- Build 12-month financial projections
- Validate business model viability
- Connect your validated assumptions to unit economics

Your validation learnings from Lab 8 will directly inform your financial assumptions in Lab 9.

**Remember:** The goal isn't to prove you're right. The goal is to learn fast and build something people actually want.

Good luck! 🚀
