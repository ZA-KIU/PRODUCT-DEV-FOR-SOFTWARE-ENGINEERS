## Decision Framework

### Interpreting Results

| Conversion Rate | Visitors | Interpretation | Next Action |
|-----------------|----------|----------------|-------------|
| > 20% | 50+ | Strong validation | Build MVP, contact all users |
| 10-20% | 50+ | Good validation | Interview users, validate problem deeper |
| 5-10% | 50+ | Weak signal | Talk to users, may need pivot |
| < 5% | 50+ | Problem or positioning | Rethink problem or value prop |
| Any | < 50 | Insufficient data | Continue until minimum sample size |

---

### Qualitative Signals

**Even if numbers are good, check:**
- [ ] Do signups match our ICP?
- [ ] Are people asking questions that suggest understanding?
- [ ] Is anyone actively asking "when can I use this?"
- [ ] Did anyone share with others?

**Red flags (even with good numbers):**
- Wrong user segment signing up
- No engagement with follow-up
- High bounce rate (< 30 seconds)
- No response to interview invitations

## Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Can't drive enough traffic | Medium | High | Multiple channels, extended timeline |
| Wrong audience sees it | Medium | High | Targeted distribution, qualify signups |
| Landing page breaks | Low | High | Test thoroughly, monitor daily |
| Get zero signups | Low | High | Set threshold (if 0 after 20 visitors, stop and rethink) |
| [Your risk] | [L/M/H] | [L/M/H] | [Strategy] |
