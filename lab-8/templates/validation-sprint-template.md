## Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|---------------------|
| Can't recruit enough participants | Medium | High | - Start outreach early<br>- Have 5+ backup channels<br>- Offer incentives if needed |
| Team member unavailable | Medium | Medium | - Cross-train on tasks<br>- Document everything<br>- Have backup owners |
| Experiments take longer than planned | Medium | High | - Build buffer time<br>- Prioritize #1 experiment<br>- Be ready to extend timeline |
| Data collection fails | Low | High | - Test tracking before launch<br>- Have manual backup<br>- Export data daily |
| Results are inconclusive | Medium | Medium | - Design follow-up experiments<br>- Talk to users for context<br>- Document what we learned |

## Pivot/Persevere Decision Framework

At end of sprint, we will use this framework:

### If ALL 3 hypotheses validated (all hit success criteria):
→ **PERSEVERE** - Full speed ahead on MVP development  
→ Next: Build features, plan beta launch

### If 2 of 3 validated:
→ **ITERATE** - Address weak point before scaling  
→ Next: Redesign experiment for invalid assumption

### If 1 of 3 validated:
→ **PIVOT** - Major changes needed  
→ Next: Team discussion on pivot direction

### If 0 of 3 validated:
→ **MAJOR PIVOT** - Core assumptions wrong  
→ Next: Return to customer discovery or change direction entirely
