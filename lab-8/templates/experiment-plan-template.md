## Overview

This document contains 3 designed experiments to test our riskiest assumptions.

**Testing Priority:**
1. [Assumption #1] → Experiment 1
2. [Assumption #2] → Experiment 2
3. [Assumption #3] → Experiment 3

---

## Experiment 1: [Descriptive Name]

### Hypothesis Statement

**We believe that** [your assumption in full - be specific]

**We will know we're right when** [specific, observable outcome with numbers]

**Example:**  
We believe that CS students will use our project coordination tool at least once per day. We will know we're right when 50%+ of our test users open the app 5+ times per week for 2 consecutive weeks.
