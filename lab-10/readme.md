## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Pitch Deck Mistakes
❌ More than 10 slides (automatic point deduction)  
❌ Dense text slides (bullet points > 5 per slide)  
❌ No data to support claims  
❌ Using jargon without explanation  
❌ No clear ask or next steps  

### Pitch Script Issues
❌ Reading slides verbatim  
❌ No rehearsal (obvious when presenting)  
❌ Going over 8 minutes  
❌ Weak opening hook  
❌ No connection between slides  

### Demo Disasters
❌ Live demo with no backup  
❌ Showing bugs or incomplete features  
❌ No clear narrative in demo  
❌ Too much clicking, not enough showing value  
❌ Demo that doesn't connect to problem statement  

---

## 💡 Success Tips

### For Your Pitch
✅ **Start with a hook** - Grab attention in first 30 seconds  
✅ **Tell a story** - Connect problem → solution → impact  
✅ **Show, don't tell** - Use visuals, data, and demos  
✅ **Practice out loud** - At least 10 times before Demo Day  
✅ **Time yourself** - Stay under 7 minutes for pitch  

### For Your Demo
✅ **Script every click** - Know exactly what you'll show  
✅ **Focus on value** - Show outcomes, not just features  
✅ **Have backup plans** - Screenshots, video, or alternative path  
✅ **Practice transitions** - Smooth handoff between pitch and demo  
✅ **Test on actual equipment** - Don't assume it will work  

### For Team Coordination
✅ **Assign roles clearly** - Who presents what slides  
✅ **Practice handoffs** - Transitions between speakers  
✅ **Agree on messaging** - Consistent story from all members  
✅ **Support each other** - Backup speaker if someone freezes  
✅ **Time each section** - Everyone stays within their allocation
