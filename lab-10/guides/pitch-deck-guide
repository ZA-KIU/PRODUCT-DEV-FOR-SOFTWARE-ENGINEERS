## The Guy Kawasaki Framework

### The 10/20/30 Rule

**10 slides** - No more, no less  
**20 minutes** - Maximum presentation time (you have 7 for Demo Day)  
**30 point font** - Minimum text size (forces conciseness)

### Why This Framework?

✅ **Forces focus** - Can't include everything, must prioritize  
✅ **Maintains attention** - Evaluators stay engaged  
✅ **Tests understanding** - If you can't explain in 10 slides, you don't understand it  
✅ **Industry standard** - VCs expect this format  

### The 10 Essential Slides

1. **Hook/Title** - Grab attention immediately
2. **Problem** - What pain are you solving?
3. **Solution** - Your unique approach
4. **Product/Demo** - Show, don't tell
5. **Market Size** - TAM, SAM, SOM
6. **Business Model** - How you make money
7. **Traction** - Validation & momentum
8. **Competition** - Your unfair advantage
9. **Team** - Why you're the ones to build this
10. **Ask/Next Steps** - What you need and why

---

## Slide-by-Slide Breakdown

### Slide 1: Hook/Title Slide

**Purpose:** Grab attention in first 30 seconds

**What to Include:**
- Company/product name
- One-sentence tagline (10-15 words max)
- Your names and roles
- Optional: Compelling visual or stat

**Four Hook Frameworks:**

**1. Shocking Statistic**
> "73% of KIU students miss opportunities because..."

**2. Personal Story**
> "Last semester, I missed a job offer because I didn't see the email. I'm not alone."

**3. Bold Vision**
> "We're making KIU the most connected university campus in Georgia"

**4. Contrarian Take**
> "Everyone thinks students need more productivity apps. They're wrong. Students need less clutter."

**Example - Good:**
```
CampusConnect
Reducing Student Opportunity Loss by 80%

By: [Team Names]
```

**Example - Bad:**
```
Our App
A Revolutionary Platform for Students

Presented by Team 5
```

**Why Bad Example Fails:**
- Generic name
- Buzzwords ("revolutionary")
- No hook or intrigue
- Doesn't communicate value

**Your Hook Checklist:**
- [ ] Clear product/company name
- [ ] Compelling tagline (not jargon)
- [ ] Creates curiosity
- [ ] Takes <30 seconds to deliver
- [ ] Sets up your story

---

### Slide 2: Problem

**Purpose:** Establish the pain you're solving

**Formula:** WHO + WHAT + WHY IT MATTERS

**What to Include:**
- Target customer segment (be specific)
- The problem they face (in their words)
- Quantified impact (time, money, frustration)
- Current broken solutions (why they fail)

**Structure:**

```
Problem:
[One sentence describing the core problem]

Who Experiences This:
[Specific segment with numbers if possible]

Current Impact:
• [Quantified consequence 1]
• [Quantified consequence 2]
• [Quantified consequence 3]

Why Existing Solutions Fail:
[Brief explanation]
```

**Example - Good:**

```
The Opportunity Loss Problem

KIU students miss 4-6 relevant opportunities per month because 
important information is scattered across email, Facebook, 
Telegram, and physical bulletin boards.

Impact:
• 68% of students have missed scholarship deadlines
• Students spend 2.5 hours/week searching for opportunities
• 85% report missing events they wanted to attend

Why WhatsApp/Email Don't Work:
Information overload + no categorization = missed opportunities
```

**Example - Bad:**

```
Problem:
Communication at universities is inefficient.

Students face challenges.

Things could be better.
```

**Why Bad Example Fails:**
- Vague and generic
- No specifics or data
- Doesn't establish pain level
- No evidence from customer interviews

**Evidence to Include:**

From your customer discovery (Weeks 1-4):
- Number of interviews conducted
- % of interviewees who experienced problem
- Direct quotes (1-2 max)
- Quantified impact from research

**Your Problem Checklist:**
- [ ] Specific target customer
- [ ] Clear problem statement
- [ ] Quantified impact
- [ ] Evidence from interviews
- [ ] Explains why current solutions fail

---

### Slide 3: Solution

**Purpose:** Present your unique approach to solving the problem

**Key Principle:** Focus on OUTCOME, not features

**What to Include:**
- Your core solution (1-2 sentences)
- How it works (high-level)
- Why it's better than alternatives
- Key differentiator

**Structure:**

```
Solution: [Product Name]

What It Does:
[One clear sentence about the transformation]

How It Works:
[Simple 3-step process or key mechanism]

Why It's Different:
[Your unique insight or approach]
```

**Example - Good:**

```
CampusConnect: A Single Feed for KIU Life

What It Does:
Aggregates all KIU opportunities—scholarships, events, jobs, 
clubs—into one personalized, categorized mobile feed.

How It Works:
1. We integrate with university systems and scan campus sources
2. AI categorizes and personalizes content to your interests
3. You get instant mobile notifications for relevant opportunities

Why It's Different:
First platform built specifically for KIU's unique information 
ecosystem—not a generic social network or calendar.
```

**Example - Bad:**

```
Solution: Our App

Features:
• Push notifications
• User profiles  
• Search functionality
• Categories
• Cloud-based
• Mobile-first
```

**Why Bad Example Fails:**
- Lists features, not outcomes
- No unique value proposition
- Could describe any app
- Doesn't connect to problem

**Outcome vs. Feature Language:**

| ❌ Feature Language | ✅ Outcome Language |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| "AI-powered categorization" | "Never miss relevant opportunities" |
| "Real-time sync across devices" | "Access opportunities anywhere, instantly" |
| "Advanced filtering system" | "See only what matters to you" |

**Your Solution Checklist:**
- [ ] Clear transformation/outcome
- [ ] Simple explanation (grandmother test)
- [ ] Differentiator highlighted
- [ ] Connects back to problem
- [ ] No jargon or technical terms

---

### Slide 4: Product/Demo

**Purpose:** Show your solution in action

**What to Include:**
- Key screenshot(s) or product visual
- 3-4 annotated highlights
- Reference to live demo or video
- Clear call to action

**Three Approaches:**

**1. Screenshot with Annotations**
Best for: Showing UI/UX and key features

```
[Large screenshot of main interface]

Key Elements (with arrows/callouts):
→ Personalized feed based on your interests
→ One-tap RSVP to events
→ Deadline countdown for scholarships
→ Share opportunities with friends
```

**2. User Flow Diagram**
Best for: Showing process improvement

```
Before: [Complex path with 7 steps]
After:  [Simplified path with 2 steps]

Time saved: 85%
```

**3. Demo Preview**
Best for: Setting up live demonstration

```
[Compelling screenshot]

Live Demo Coming:
We'll show you how Sarah, a KIU sophomore, 
discovers and applies to a scholarship in under 60 seconds.

(See video backup if demo fails)
```

**Demo Strategy:**

**DO:**
- ✅ Show 60-90 second demo after pitch
- ✅ Narrate what's happening
- ✅ Focus on user value, not clicks
- ✅ Use realistic data/scenario
- ✅ Have backup video ready

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Live demo without rehearsal
- ❌ Show bugs or incomplete features
- ❌ Explain code or technical architecture
- ❌ Click through every feature
- ❌ Rely solely on live demo (always have backup)

**Your Product/Demo Checklist:**
- [ ] Visually clear screenshot
- [ ] Highlights key value props
- [ ] Connects to problem/solution
- [ ] Demo is scripted and timed
- [ ] Backup plan exists

---

### Slide 5: Market Size

**Purpose:** Show the business opportunity

**Framework:** TAM → SAM → SOM

**What to Include:**
- Total Addressable Market (TAM)
- Serviceable Available Market (SAM)
- Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)
- Growth trajectory
- Market trends supporting your timing

**Structure:**

```
Market Opportunity

TAM (Total Addressable Market):
$XXX million - [Entire market size]
[How calculated]

SAM (Serviceable Available Market):
$XX million - [Realistic market you can serve]
[How calculated]

SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market):
$X million - [What you can capture in 3-5 years]
[How calculated]

Why Now:
[Market trend or shift creating opportunity]
```

**Example - Good:**

```
$2.3M Market Opportunity at Georgian Universities

TAM: $12.5M
• 160,000 university students in Georgia
• $78/student/year average spend on edu software
• 160,000 × $78 = $12.5M

SAM: $4.2M
• 54,000 students at Tbilisi & Kutaisi universities
• 54,000 × $78 = $4.2M

SOM: $2.3M (by Year 3)
• Target: 30,000 students (55% of SAM)
• 30,000 × $78 = $2.3M

Why Now:
Georgian universities digitizing post-COVID → 
perfect timing for unified student platform
```

**Example - Bad:**

```
Market Size

The education market is worth billions.

There are millions of students.

We will capture 1% which is still a lot.
```

**Why Bad Example Fails:**
- No specific numbers
- No calculation methodology
- Too broad (global vs. your market)
- No realistic path to market share

**Calculation Methods:**

**Top-Down (Start with big number):**
```
Market reports → 
Filter to your segment → 
Calculate your addressable portion
```

**Bottom-Up (Start with customer):**
```
Average revenue per customer × 
Number of reachable customers = 
Total market opportunity
```

**Your Market Size Checklist:**
- [ ] TAM, SAM, SOM all calculated
- [ ] Methodology explained
- [ ] Numbers are realistic
- [ ] Growth trajectory shown
- [ ] Timing/trends explained

### Slide 6: Business Model

**Purpose:** Show how you make money and unit economics

**What to Include:**
- Revenue model (how you charge)
- Pricing strategy
- Unit economics (CAC, LTV, ratio)
- Path to profitability
- Key assumptions

**Structure:**

```
Business Model: [Type]

Revenue Model:
[How you charge - subscription, transaction, etc.]

Pricing:
[Specific price points and rationale]

Unit Economics:
• CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost): $XX
• LTV (Lifetime Value): $XXX  
• LTV:CAC Ratio: X:1
• Payback Period: X months

Path to Profitability:
[When and how you become profitable]
```

**Example - Good:**

```
Freemium SaaS Model

Revenue Model:
• Free tier: Basic event discovery
• Premium ($4.99/month): Scholarship alerts, priority access
• Enterprise ($199/month): Whole-club admin tools

Target Mix: 15% premium conversion (industry standard: 10-15%)

Unit Economics:
• CAC: $12 (Instagram ads + referrals)
• LTV: $89 (avg. 18-month subscription @ $4.99/mo)
• LTV:CAC Ratio: 7.4:1 ✅ (target: >3:1)
• Payback Period: 2.4 months ✅ (target: <12 mo)

Profitability: Month 18 at 2,000 paying users
```

**Example - Bad:**

```
Business Model

We will charge users for premium features.

Some users will pay, some won't.

We will make money eventually.
```

**Why Bad Example Fails:**
- No specific pricing
- No unit economics
- No evidence or benchmarks
- No path to profitability

**Common Revenue Models:**

**SaaS/Subscription:**
- Monthly or annual recurring revenue
- Example: $9.99/month per user

**Freemium:**
- Free basic, paid premium features
- Example: 10-15% conversion rate

**Transaction Fee:**
- Percentage of each transaction
- Example: 3% of event ticket sales

**Marketplace:**
- Commission on matches/sales
- Example: 15% commission on tutoring bookings

**Enterprise/B2B:**
- Per-seat or per-organization pricing
- Example: $1,999/year for university license

**Connecting to Lab 9 Financial Model:**

Your Lab 9 deliverables directly inform this slide:
- ✅ Use your calculated CAC from financial model
- ✅ Use your calculated LTV from cohort analysis
- ✅ Reference your 12-month revenue projections
- ✅ Show your unit economics dashboard metrics

**Your Business Model Checklist:**
- [ ] Clear revenue model
- [ ] Specific pricing
- [ ] CAC calculated and realistic
- [ ] LTV calculated with rationale
- [ ] LTV:CAC ratio > 3:1
- [ ] Payback period < 12 months
- [ ] Path to profitability shown

### Slide 7: Traction

**Purpose:** Prove validation and momentum

**Key Message:** You don't need millions of users. You need evidence that your assumptions are validated.

**What to Include:**
- Concrete validation metrics
- Customer evidence (interviews, signups, LOIs)
- Usage data (if you have users)
- Momentum indicators
- Map your coursework to traction

**The Classwork-to-Traction Map:**

| Course Work | Validation Evidence | Traction Metric |
|-------------|-------------------|----------------|
| 25 customer interviews | 82% confirmed problem | Problem Validation ✅ |
| Landing page + ads | 247 signups in 2 weeks | Market Interest ✅ |
| Smoke test | 28% clicked "Pre-order" | Purchase Intent ✅ |
| Beta users | 15 active users, 60% D7 retention | Product Validation ✅ |
| Design partners | 2 LOIs from KIU clubs | Revenue Potential ✅ |

**Structure:**

```
Traction & Validation

Customer Discovery:
• XX interviews → XX% confirmed problem
• Direct quote: "[Compelling user quote]"

Early Adoption:
• Landing page: XXX signups
• Beta users: XX active
• Retention: XX% Day 7 retention

Business Development:
• X letters of intent
• X design partner agreements
• $X in pilot revenue

Momentum:
[What's growing and how fast]
```

**Example - Good:**

```
Strong Early Validation

Customer Validation (Weeks 1-4):
• 27 KIU students interviewed
• 85% experienced problem monthly
• 74% would pay $4.99/month

Market Interest (Weeks 5-8):
• Landing page: 412 email signups (22% conversion)
• Instagram ad test: $47 spend → 89 signups ($0.53/signup)

Product Validation (Weeks 9-11):
• 23 beta users (from waitlist)
• 65% Day 7 retention (target: 40%)
• Avg. 4.2 sessions/week per user

Business Traction:
• 2 student organizations committed (115 members)
• KIU Career Center interested in partnership
• $0 revenue yet, but validated willingness to pay

Growth: Signups growing 35% week-over-week
```

**Example - Bad:**

```
Traction

We've talked to people.

People like our idea.

We think we'll get lots of users.
```

**Why Bad Example Fails:**
- No specific numbers
- No evidence
- Future-focused (not actual traction)
- Doesn't reference actual work done

**What if You Have Limited Traction?**

**BE HONEST. But frame it strategically:**

Instead of: "We don't have users yet."

Say: "We've validated core assumptions through 25 interviews and a landing page test with 200+ signups. We're now focused on converting waitlist to active users."

**Your Traction Checklist:**
- [ ] Specific numbers (not "many" or "several")
- [ ] Multiple validation types
- [ ] References actual course work
- [ ] Shows momentum/growth
- [ ] Includes qualitative evidence (quotes)
- [ ] Honest about current state

---

### Slide 8: Competition

**Purpose:** Show you understand the market and have a defensible position

**Key Principle:** NEVER say "we have no competition"

**What to Include:**
- Competitive landscape (who else is playing)
- 2×2 positioning matrix
- Your unfair advantages
- Why you'll win

**The 2×2 Matrix:**

Choose two dimensions that matter to your customer:

```
        High Cost
            |
Generic ----+---- Personalized
            |
        Low Cost
```

Position yourself in the best quadrant, competitors in others.

**Structure:**

```
Competitive Landscape

[2×2 Matrix Visual]

Direct Competitors:
• [Competitor 1]: [What they do, why they're limited]
• [Competitor 2]: [What they do, why they're limited]

Indirect Competitors:
• [Current solution]: [Why inadequate]

Our Unfair Advantages:
1. [Advantage 1 - specific and defensible]
2. [Advantage 2 - specific and defensible]
3. [Advantage 3 - specific and defensible]

Why We'll Win:
[Your unique insight or position]
```

**Example - Good:**

```
Competitive Position

[Matrix showing]:
• Facebook Groups: High reach, low relevance
• Email newsletters: High relevance, low engagement  
• WhatsApp: High engagement, high noise
• CampusConnect: High relevance, high engagement

Our Unfair Advantages:

1. KIU-Specific Integration
   Built for KIU's unique system—not generic

2. First-Mover Advantage at KIU
   Already 400+ signups, network effects building

3. Direct University Partnerships
   Working with Career Center & Student Affairs
   → Official data access competitors can't get

Why We'll Win:
We're the only solution purpose-built for KIU's 
information ecosystem with official university backing.
```

**Example - Bad:**

```
Competition

We have no real competitors.

Our solution is unique.

Others are solving different problems.
```

**Why Bad Example Fails:**
- Claiming no competition is a red flag
- Shows lack of market understanding
- Doesn't acknowledge alternatives
- No defensibility explained

**Common Mistakes:**

❌ "We have no competition" (never say this)  
❌ Putting "You Are Here" sticker on slide (cheesy)  
❌ Only showing weak competitors (cherry-picking)  
❌ Not acknowledging why customers use alternatives  
❌ Listing features as advantages (features are copiable)  

**Real Unfair Advantages:**

✅ **Network Effects** - Value increases with more users  
✅ **Proprietary Data** - Unique dataset competitors can't access  
✅ **Partnerships** - Exclusive relationships  
✅ **Team Expertise** - Unique domain knowledge  
✅ **First-Mover** - Early lock-in with switching costs  
✅ **Technology** - Patent or hard-to-replicate tech  

**Your Competition Checklist:**
- [ ] Acknowledges alternatives/competitors
- [ ] 2×2 matrix clearly positions you
- [ ] Lists 2-3 specific unfair advantages
- [ ] Advantages are defensible
- [ ] Explains why you'll win
