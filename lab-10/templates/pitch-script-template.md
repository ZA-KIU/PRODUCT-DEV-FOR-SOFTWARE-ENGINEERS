## Your Pitch Script

### PART 1: HOOK & PROBLEM [0:00-1:30] (90 seconds)

**Speaker:** _________________

**[SLIDE 1: Title/Hook]** `[0:00]`

---

**Opening Line (The Hook):**

_[Write your attention-grabbing opening. Choose from: shocking stat, personal story, bold vision, or contrarian take]_

Example:
"Last month, 127 KIU students missed scholarship deadlines worth over ₾85,000. Not because they didn't qualify—but because they never saw the announcement."

**Your Hook:**

```



```

`[0:15]` **Transition to Team Introduction:**

_[Briefly introduce yourself and team]_

Example:
"Hi, I'm Mariam, and this is Giorgi and Nino. We're [Product Name], and we're solving this problem."

**Your Introduction:**

```


```

---

**[SLIDE 2: Problem]** `[0:30]`

**Problem Statement:**

_[WHO experiences WHAT problem and WHY it matters. Include quantified impact.]_

Example:
"Here's the problem: KIU students get important information through six different channels—email, Facebook, Telegram, Instagram, the student portal, and physical bulletin boards. [PAUSE]

On average, students spend 2.5 hours every week searching for opportunities, and still miss 40% of relevant ones. We know because we interviewed 27 students, and 85% told us the same story."

**Your Problem Statement:**

```






```

**Supporting Evidence:**

_[Add 1-2 data points or a powerful quote]_

Example:
"As one student told us: 'I missed a research assistant position because the email was buried under 200 other messages.' This isn't just annoying—it's affecting students' futures."

**Your Evidence:**

```



```

`[1:15]` **Problem-to-Solution Transition:**

_[Bridge to your solution naturally]_

Example:
"That's why we built CampusConnect."

**Your Transition:**

```

```

---

### PART 2: SOLUTION [1:30-2:30] (60 seconds)

**Speaker:** _________________ `[Continue same speaker or mark transition]`

**[SLIDE 3: Solution]** `[1:30]`

**Solution Statement:**

_[What you built and how it solves the problem. Focus on OUTCOME, not features.]_

Example:
"CampusConnect is a single, personalized feed for all KIU opportunities—scholarships, events, jobs, and clubs. Instead of checking six places, students check one app.

Here's how it works: [GESTURE to slide]
First, we integrate with university systems and scan all campus information sources.
Second, our AI categorizes and personalizes content based on each student's interests.
Third, students get instant mobile notifications for relevant opportunities.

The result? Students go from spending 2.5 hours a week searching, to spending 5 minutes a day staying informed."

**Your Solution:**

```








```

`[2:15]` **Solution-to-Product Transition:**

_[Transition to showing your product]_

Example:
"Let me show you exactly what this looks like."

**Your Transition:**

```

```

---

### PART 3: PRODUCT/DEMO [2:30-4:00] (90 seconds)

**Speaker:** _________________ `[Continue same or mark transition]`

**[SLIDE 4: Product Screenshot]** `[2:30]`

**Product Walkthrough:**

_[Describe key features visible in screenshot. Point to specific elements.]_

Example:
"When Sarah, a second-year CS student, opens CampusConnect, she sees: [GESTURE]

→ A personalized feed showing only opportunities relevant to her: CS events, hackathons, tech internships.
→ Deadline countdowns so she never misses an application deadline.
→ One-tap actions—RSVP, save, or share with friends.
→ Smart categorization—everything is organized automatically."

**Your Product Walkthrough:**

```






```

`[2:50]` **Transition to Live Demo:**

_[Announce you'll show a quick demo]_

Example:
"Let me show you this in action. I'll walk through a real scenario."

**Your Transition:**

```

```

---

**[LIVE DEMO OR DEMO VIDEO]** `[2:55]`

**Demo Script:**

_[Write exactly what you'll say during demo. Narrate every action. Keep to 60 seconds MAX.]_

Example:
"Sarah opens the app. [CLICK] She immediately sees a scholarship opportunity posted 30 minutes ago.

[SCROLL] She can see all the details—amount, deadline, eligibility requirements—right here.

[CLICK] With one tap, she saves it to her calendar with a reminder 24 hours before the deadline.

[CLICK] She can also share it with her friend Nina, who's also eligible.

[SHOW NOTIFICATION] Later, when the Career Center posts a job opportunity, Sarah gets a push notification because it matches her interests. She doesn't miss it because it's buried in an email thread."

**Your Demo Script:**

```










```

**Demo Backup Plan:**

_[If live demo fails, what do you say?]_

```
"And if the live demo gives us any trouble today, we have a backup video showing the full experience."
```

`[3:55]` **Demo-to-Business Transition:**

_[Connect product to business opportunity]_

Example:
"This isn't just a better experience for students—it's a real business opportunity."

**Your Transition:**

```

```

---

### PART 4: MARKET & BUSINESS MODEL [4:00-5:15] (75 seconds)

**Speaker:** _________________ `[Continue same or mark transition]`

**[SLIDE 5: Market Size]** `[4:00]`

**Market Opportunity:**

_[Present TAM, SAM, SOM with clear calculations]_

Example:
"The market opportunity is significant. [GESTURE to slide]

Total Addressable Market: ₾12.5 million. That's 160,000 university students in Georgia, at an average of ₾78 per student per year for educational software.

Our Serviceable Available Market: ₾4.2 million. We're focusing on Tbilisi and Kutaisi universities—54,000 students.

Our target for the first three years: ₾2.3 million in revenue, reaching 30,000 students.

And the timing is perfect—Georgian universities are digitizing post-COVID, creating the perfect moment for a unified student platform."

**Your Market Opportunity:**

```








```

---

**[SLIDE 6: Business Model]** `[4:30]`

**Business Model & Unit Economics:**

_[Explain how you make money and show your unit economics]_

Example:
"Here's how we make money: [GESTURE to slide]

We use a freemium model. Basic event discovery is free. Premium costs ₾4.99 per month and includes scholarship alerts, priority access to limited spots, and advanced filters. Enterprise accounts for clubs and departments cost ₾199 per month.

Our unit economics are strong:
• Customer acquisition cost: ₾12
• Lifetime value: ₾89
• That's a 7:1 ratio—well above the 3:1 benchmark

We reach profitability at month 18 with 2,000 paying users."

**Your Business Model:**

```









```

`[5:10]` **Business-to-Traction Transition:**

_[Connect business model to actual traction]_

Example:
"And we're not just projecting—we're already seeing validation."

**Your Transition:**

```

```

---

### PART 5: TRACTION & COMPETITION [5:15-6:15] (60 seconds)

**Speaker:** _________________ `[Continue same or mark transition]`

**[SLIDE 7: Traction]** `[5:15]`

**Traction Evidence:**

_[Show specific validation metrics from your coursework]_

Example:
"Over the past 11 weeks, we've built real traction: [GESTURE to slide]

Customer validation: 27 interviews with 85% confirming the problem.

Market interest: 412 email signups from our landing page with a 22% conversion rate. That cost us ₾47 in Instagram ads—just 53 tetri per signup.

Product validation: 23 beta users, 65% of whom are still active after 7 days. That's above our 40% target.

And business traction: We have signed agreements with 2 student organizations representing 115 members, and the KIU Career Center wants to partner.

Signups are growing 35% week-over-week."

**Your Traction:**

```








```

---

**[SLIDE 8: Competition]** `[5:45]`

**Competitive Position:**

_[Acknowledge competition and explain your advantages]_

Example:
"Now, we're not alone in this space. Students currently use Facebook groups, WhatsApp, and email newsletters. [GESTURE to 2x2 matrix]

But here's the difference: Facebook groups have high reach but low relevance—too much noise. Email has high relevance but low engagement—nobody checks it. WhatsApp has high engagement but gets cluttered quickly.

We're the only solution with both high relevance AND high engagement because we're built specifically for KIU's information ecosystem.

Our unfair advantages:
First, KIU-specific integration—we're not a generic social network.
Second, first-mover advantage—we already have 400 signups, creating network effects.
Third, official university partnerships that give us data access competitors can't get."

**Your Competition:**

```








```

`[6:10]` **Competition-to-Team Transition:**

_[Connect competitive advantages to your team]_

Example:
"And we're the right team to execute on this."

**Your Transition:**

```

```

---

### PART 6: TEAM & ASK [6:15-7:00] (45 seconds)

**Speaker:** _________________ `[Continue same or mark transition]`

**[SLIDE 9: Team]** `[6:15]`

**Team Introduction:**

_[Briefly highlight why your team is uniquely qualified]_

Example:
"I'm Mariam, CEO. I'm president of the Career Club with 200 members, and I've experienced this problem firsthand running campus events.

Giorgi, our CTO, has built two mobile apps with over 1,000 downloads and won last year's KIU Hackathon.

Nino, our Head of Design, has a UX certificate and has designed interfaces for two campus organizations.

We're not outsiders trying to fix university life—we're students building for ourselves and our peers. We live this problem every day."

**Your Team Intro:**

```






```

---

**[SLIDE 10: Ask / Next Steps]** `[6:35]`

**The Ask & Next Steps:**

_[Clear call to action and milestones]_

Example:
"Here's what's next: [GESTURE to slide]

We're launching publicly in January 2025. Our goal is 500 active users at KIU by end of January.

In February, we expand to three Tbilisi universities, targeting 1,500 total users.

By March, we want five university departments as enterprise customers.

What we need from you: introductions to university administrators, beta testers from your networks, and mentorship from people who've built successful products.

You can reach us at team@campusconnect.ge, or try the app yourself at app.campusconnect.ge.

[FINAL LINE - memorable closing]
We're building the future of university life, one notification at a time. Thank you!"
