# Mom Test Quick Reference Checklist

This checklist is a practical guide to help you conduct unbiased customer interviews. Keep it close during your conversations to ensure you adhere to the Mom Test principles.

## The Three Core Rules

1. **Talk about their life instead of your idea.** Ask about specific behaviours and past actions rather than pitching a solution or future scenarios.
2. **Ask about specifics in the past.** Focus on when, where, and how often a problem occurs. Avoid hypothetical questions that invite speculation.
3. **Talk less and listen more.** Let the interviewee do most of the talking. Use silence to encourage them to elaborate.

## Pre‑Interview Checklist

- Review your script and key objectives.
- Prepare your recording device or note‑taking setup.
- Double‑check your screener questions to verify ICP fit.
- Plan your first three questions to open the conversation.
- Confirm the interview time and place with the participant.

## During Interview Checklist

- Start by building rapport; make them comfortable.
- Ask for permission to record if applicable.
- Verify that they match your ICP using screener questions.
- Explore their past behaviour in detail (who, what, when, why).
- Use the Five Whys to uncover root causes.
- Capture verbatim quotes with context.
- Avoid leading or biased questions.
- End by asking for referrals and thanking them.

## Red Flags to Avoid

- You find yourself describing your idea or pitching a solution.
- Questions start with “Would you…?” or “Do you think…?”
- You accept vague statements such as “usually” or “sometimes.”
- You are doing most of the talking.

## Green Flags You’re Doing It Right

- The interviewee is telling stories about specific past events.
- You are hearing emotions, struggles, and motivations in their words.
- You are learning unexpected things that challenge assumptions.
- You are listening more than speaking.

## Questions to Never Ask

- “Would you buy this?”
- “Do you like my idea?”
- “How much would you pay?”

These questions lead to false positives and do not uncover real behaviour.

## Power Questions to Use

- “Tell me about the last time this happened.”
- “How did you try to solve it?”
- “What happened after that?”
- “How much time or money did you spend?”

## Note‑Taking Strategy

- Write down verbatim quotes, not paraphrases.
- Capture context around each quote (what question prompted it).
- Note emotional cues such as tone of voice and body language.
- Flag surprises and contradictions for later synthesis.

## Success Mantra

“Stay curious, dig into the past, and let them talk.”
