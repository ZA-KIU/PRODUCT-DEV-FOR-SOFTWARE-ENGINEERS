# Five Whys Guide

The Five Whys technique helps you uncover the root cause of a problem by repeatedly asking “why” until you reach the underlying reason. Use this guide to structure your questioning and avoid stopping at the surface.

## What Is the Five Whys?

It is a simple method to explore cause‑and‑effect relationships. Starting from an observed problem, you ask “why?” about the answer until you reach a fundamental cause. Five iterations are typical, but the actual number can vary.

## Surface vs. Root Cause

- **Surface problem:** A description of what is happening, often expressed as a symptom (e.g., “We always scramble before deadlines”).
- **Root cause:** The underlying reason the symptom keeps occurring (e.g., “We never assign tasks clearly, so no one knows who is responsible”).

## The Five Whys Process

1. **State the problem clearly.** Write down what happened as described by the interviewee.
2. **Ask why the problem occurred.** Encourage them to provide a specific reason.
3. **Ask why that reason exists.** Dive deeper into their answer.
4. **Repeat until you reach the underlying cause.** This often requires three to five iterations.
5. **Summarise the root cause.** Restate it in your own words to confirm understanding.

## Conversation Example

*Problem:* “Our group project is always chaotic.”

*Why #1:* Why is it chaotic?  
*Answer:* “Because we start working the night before it’s due.”

*Why #2:* Why do you start so late?  
*Answer:* “We don’t know when everyone is working on it.”

*Why #3:* Why don’t you know?  
*Answer:* “We never assign tasks; everyone assumes someone else will do it.”

*Root cause:* Lack of clear task assignment.

## Question Templates

- “Why does that matter?”
- “What causes that to happen?”
- “What makes that difficult?”
- “Why do you think it’s like that?”

## How to Know You’ve Reached the Root Cause

- The interviewee starts repeating themselves or runs out of answers.
- The answers become more about beliefs or systems than about symptoms.
- Fixing this cause would prevent the problem from recurring.

## Common Mistakes

- Stopping after the first why and accepting a superficial answer.
- Asking “why” mechanically without listening to the content.
- Leading the interviewee to a particular answer.

## When to Stop Digging

Stop when:

- The cause is outside the interviewee’s control.
- Further questions yield no new insights.
- The issue goes beyond the scope of your problem space.

## Documentation Template

When documenting, include:

- The surface problem statement.
- Each why question and the interviewee’s response.
- Your assessment of the root cause.

Use the Five Whys section in the interview log template for this purpose.
