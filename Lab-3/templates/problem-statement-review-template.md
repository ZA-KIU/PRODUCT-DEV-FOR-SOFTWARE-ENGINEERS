## Analysis: Validation or Challenge?

### What Interviews VALIDATED ‚úÖ

[Which aspects of your original problem statement were confirmed by interviews? Be specific.]

**Example:**
"Interviews confirmed that third-year CS students do experience significant coordination problems with group projects. All 3 interviewees independently mentioned last-minute rescue missions where they had to redo teammates' work."

**Your Validation:**

**WHO (ICP) - Validated?** ‚òê Yes ‚òê No ‚òê Partially  
[Explain: Did you interview the right people? Do they match your ICP? What was confirmed?]

**WHAT (Problem) - Validated?** ‚òê Yes ‚òê No ‚òê Partially  
[Explain: Is this the real problem they experience? What was confirmed?]

**WHEN/WHERE (Context) - Validated?** ‚òê Yes ‚òê No ‚òê Partially  
[Explain: Does the problem occur in the situations you expected? What was confirmed?]

**WHY (Root Cause) - Validated?** ‚òê Yes ‚òê No ‚òê Partially  
[Explain: Is your understanding of why the problem exists correct? What was confirmed?]

**IMPACT (Consequences) - Validated?** ‚òê Yes ‚òê No ‚òê Partially  
[Explain: Are the consequences as severe as you thought? What was confirmed?]

**Supporting Evidence:**

- Interview #___: "[Another validating quote]"

### What Interviews CHALLENGED ‚ùå

[Which aspects were different from your original assumptions? Be honest.]

**Example:**
"We assumed the problem was lack of task assignment at the start of projects. Interviews revealed teams DO assign tasks clearly, but the real problem is lack of progress visibility between kickoff and deadline. People don't know if work is actually happening until it's too late."

**Your Challenges:**

**WHO (ICP) - Challenged?**  
[Did you interview the wrong people? Is your ICP too broad/narrow? What was wrong?]

**WHAT (Problem) - Challenged?**  
[Is the problem different than you thought? More/less severe? Different aspect? What was wrong?]

**WHEN/WHERE (Context) - Challenged?**  
[Does the problem happen in different situations than expected? What was wrong?]

**WHY (Root Cause) - Challenged?**  
[Is the root cause different than you assumed? Deeper? Elsewhere? What was wrong?]

**IMPACT (Consequences) - Challenged?**  
[Are consequences different than expected? More/less severe? Different type? What was wrong?]

**Evidence of Challenges:**
- Interview #___: "[Quote showing contradiction]"
- Interview #___: "[Another contradicting quote]"
- Interview #___: "[Another contradicting quote]"

### What's SURPRISING or UNEXPECTED ü§î

[What did you learn that you didn't anticipate at all? These are often the most valuable insights.]

**Example:**
"Interviewees have already tried 'obvious' solutions like Trello and Asana. These tools failed not because of capability, but because of adoption - people set them up enthusiastically but stop updating after 3-4 days. The problem isn't lack of tools; it's sustained behavior change."
