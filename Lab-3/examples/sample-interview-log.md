## Key Quotes (Verbatim)

### Quote 1: Last‑minute scramble

**What they said (verbatim):**  
"We always end up pulling an all‑nighter the day before the deadline because nobody knows who’s doing what until the last minute."

**Context:**  
This was in response to a question about how she and her team handle tasks during group projects.

**Why it matters:**  
It highlights a recurring problem with planning and communication that leads to stress and decreased quality.

---

### Quote 2: Unclear ownership

**What they said (verbatim):**  
"The worst part is when two of us work on the same thing, and something else doesn’t get done because we assumed someone else had it."

**Context:**  
She was describing a specific incident in which overlapping work occurred.

**Why it matters:**  
It shows a lack of task assignment and tracking, leading to duplicated effort and gaps.

---

### Quote 3: Avoiding project management tools

**What they said (verbatim):**  
"We tried using Trello once, but it felt like extra work and no one kept it updated after the first week."

**Context:**  
This comment came up when asked about solutions they have tried.

**Why it matters:**  
It reveals that existing tools may be too heavy or require sustained discipline, indicating a gap for a more natural solution.

## Problem Deep Dive

### The Story: What Happened

Alex described a recent project in her software engineering course. The team of four agreed to meet weekly and communicate via Discord. During the second week they brainstormed features but did not assign specific tasks. Everyone assumed they would talk again mid‑week, but the group chat went quiet. Two days before the deadline, Alex noticed no code had been committed. She messaged the group at midnight asking for updates. Two members admitted they had not started. The fourth member replied the next morning.

Panic set in. Alex and one teammate pulled an all‑nighter to build a basic prototype. Another teammate started writing documentation. When they merged their work, they realised two of them had implemented the same feature while another critical piece was missing. They submitted a rushed project with known issues. Alex felt frustrated and blamed the lack of clear task assignment. She said, “I was so stressed I barely slept that week.”

The consequence was a lower grade and tension within the team. She vowed not to repeat the mistake but admitted it happens in almost every project.

### Five Whys / Root Cause Exploration

**Surface problem:** They pulled an all‑nighter before the deadline because tasks were not clear.

**Why #1:** Why were tasks not clear?  
**Their answer:** “We didn’t assign them; everyone assumed someone else would pick things up.”

**Why #2:** Why did you not assign them?  
**Their answer:** “We thought it would be obvious who would do what based on interests, so we didn’t formalise it.”

**Why #3:** Why did you think it would be obvious?  
**Their answer:** “In earlier classes, the workload was smaller, and informal coordination was fine.”

**Why #4:** Why didn’t you adjust when projects became larger?  
**Their answer:** “No one wants to be the person telling others what to do. It feels awkward.”

**Root cause assessment:** The team avoids explicit task assignment due to discomfort with taking charge, leading to assumptions and last‑minute chaos.

### Emotional Impact

**How did they describe feeling?**  
Stressed, frustrated, and anxious.

**What words did they use?**  
“All‑nighter,” “panic,” “frustrated,” and “awkward.”

**Physical/behavioural indicators:**  
She laughed nervously when recalling the incident and sighed when mentioning the grade.

**Impact on her life:**  
She lost sleep, felt resentment toward teammates, and questioned whether group projects teach useful collaboration skills.

### Frequency & Pattern

**How often does this occur?**  
Every project involving more than two people, typically two or three times per semester.

**Is there a pattern?**  
The problem arises when roles are not explicitly assigned at the start. It is worse in courses with vague project requirements.

**Has the frequency changed over time?**  
It has increased as course projects have become more complex.

**Other instances mentioned:**  
She recalled another project where two members wrote the same report section while no one collected user feedback.

## Current Solutions & Workarounds

### What They Currently Do

**Primary solution/workaround:** They create a shared Google Doc with a rough task list but rarely assign owners.

**How they discovered it:** A tutor recommended writing down tasks after a previous failure.

**How long they have used it:** Since the start of this semester.

### What Works

- Everyone can see which tasks are needed.
- It prompts discussion about missing pieces.

### What Does Not Work

- Without assigned owners, tasks still fall through the cracks.
- People forget to update the document.
- It feels like extra work and lacks accountability.

### Tools & Resources Used

**Tools/apps/systems:**

- **Discord:** Used for chat; useful for quick questions but hard to track tasks.
- **Google Docs:** Used to list tasks; not integrated with their workflow.
- **GitHub Issues:** Used by one teammate once; others ignored it.

**Other resources:**

- Class forums and friends for advice on tools.

### Alternatives They Have Tried

1. **Trello** – Abandoned after a week because no one updated cards.
2. **Group text messaging** – Too noisy; tasks got lost in the chatter.
3. **Email threads** – Slow and disorganised.

**Why current approach is “least bad”:** It is lightweight and doesn’t require everyone to learn a new tool, even though it lacks accountability.

## Key Insights & Learnings

### Surprising Findings

She expressed discomfort with taking charge, suggesting social dynamics prevent explicit task assignment even when everyone recognises the need.

### Contradictions or Tensions

Although she dislikes last‑minute scrambles, she still resists formal processes because they “feel like extra work.”

### Patterns Emerging

Similar to two earlier interviews, the issue of unclear task ownership and avoidance of leadership emerged strongly.

### Questions Raised

- Why do students view explicit task assignment as awkward?
- Would a tool that subtly assigns tasks without someone being the “boss” help?
- How might incentives or accountability be introduced without adding overhead?

### Confidence Level

☑ Somewhat confident  

**Why?** She provided concrete examples and emotional reactions. However, more interviews are needed to confirm whether this is pervasive across commuting and non‑commuting students.

## Next Steps & Follow‑Up

### Referrals Provided

She offered to connect us with two other classmates who are currently struggling with a database project.

### Future Contact

☐ Participate in future testing  
☑ Be contacted for follow‑up questions  
☐ Review a prototype  
☐ Join a beta test

**Best way to reach her:** Discord DM

### Interviewer Notes

**What went well?** Building rapport at the start helped her open up. Using silence encouraged detailed stories.

**What could be improved?** I should have asked more about how they attempted to assign tasks in previous projects.

**Follow‑up actions:**

- [ ] Reach out to her referrals.
- [ ] Ask future interviewees about social dynamics around leadership.

## Post‑Interview Reflection

**Date logged:** 2025‑10‑17  
**Time to document:** 40 minutes

**One‑sentence summary:** Lack of explicit task assignment due to discomfort with leadership leads to last‑minute chaos and stress in group projects.
