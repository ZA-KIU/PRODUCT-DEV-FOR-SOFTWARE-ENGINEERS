# Lab 3: Interview Execution & Documentation

Date: Friday, October 17, 2025  
Duration: 120 minutes (2 hours)  
Due Date: Friday, October 24, 2025 at 11:59 PM

Welcome to Lab 3. This lab marks the transition from preparation to execution. You have built your interview script in Lab 2. Now it is time to conduct real customer‑discovery interviews and document them properly.

## Overview

By the end of this lab and the following week, you will have completed and documented three to five high‑quality customer interviews that reveal genuine insights about your problem space. Everything else in this course—your problem statement, your solution design, and your go‑to‑market strategy—depends on what you learn from these interviews.

Poor interview execution leads to poor product decisions later. The goal is to learn, not to seek confirmation for an idea.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this lab you will be able to:

1. Execute interviews using Mom Test principles and Five Whys technique.
2. Practise active listening and strategic follow‑up questioning.
3. Document interviews with verbatim quotes and structured observations.
4. Review problem statements based on early interview evidence.
5. Identify patterns emerging across multiple interviews.
6. Maintain interview velocity to complete ten or more interviews by Week 5.
